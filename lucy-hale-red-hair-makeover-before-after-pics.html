The former <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pretty Little Liars</a> star took to Instagram on Sept. 28 to debut a new auburn red color that’s beautiful departure from her gorgeous naturally dark brunette hair. She shared a video running her fingers through the top of her tresses, which were styled in flattering shoulder-length waves. At the end she opened her mouth in a wide smile and her eyes grew big, as if to say “surprise!” to her followers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The 31-year-old told fans she “did a thing” in the caption of her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>red hair makeover</a> video. She tagged her hair colorist <strong>Kristin Ess</strong>, who <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reposted</a> the vid to her Instagram page. Kristen wrote in the caption, “I mean!!!! This gets an in-feed post. @lucyhale has had every hair color under the sun EXCEPT red. My lil colorist heart is full and now we officially know this chick looks good <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>with any hair color</a>.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kristin then gave props to Lucy, adding, “thank you for trusting me to do this (and thank you for Covid testing w me beforehand),” noting how they were coronavirus-free before getting together for the coloring session. Lucy wrote in the comments, “I’ve always had the feistiness of a redhead so this is fitting.” Kristen then sweetly called the actress, “<span>my lil cayenne pepper!” after the spicy red veggie.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lucy-hale-hair-makeover-light-brown-ap-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kristin has worked with Lucy for years and really has helped the star work her way through various colors.&nbsp;On Feb. 7, 2016 Lucy debuted a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>golden blonde</a> hair makeover via her Instagram and wrote in the caption, “I dye. thank you @kristin_ess for temporarily making me the blonde alter ego I’ve always wanted to be.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>At the time, Kristin explained to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Allure</a> that&nbsp;“Lucy isn’t filming right now; she’s in between filming a new movie called&nbsp;Dude&nbsp;and going back to&nbsp;PLL. She just loves to try fun new things when she—very rarely—has time off. She’s such a dream client that way. We decided blonde was the way to go.” Lucy currently has two movies in pre-production and one in post, so now is the perfect window for her to try out being a redhead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH16e5FxZqWtk656qa3LnmSrnZRitaK10WakmqOVpMOmvoybnJ%2Bnopp6orLTnqlmqJmYwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
