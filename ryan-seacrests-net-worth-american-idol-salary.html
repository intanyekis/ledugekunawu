Additionally, we'll also be covering some of the most impressive salaries from his other television ventures, including his deals with E! and NBC and his upcoming appearance on The Wheel of Fortune. We'll also learn whether he's the highest-paid TV host in the world. Let's find out exactly <strong>how much of Ryan Seacrest's $450 million came from American Idol.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-did-ryan-seacrest-make-from-american-idol>How Much Did Ryan Seacrest Make From American Idol?</h2><p>Prior to his appearance on American Idol in 2002, Ryan Seacrest hosted ESPN, a children's game show called Gladiator 2000, a fictional game show on Beverly Hills, 90210, and NBD Saturday Night Movie, to name a few. But it was Fox's American Idol that launched him into national and international stardom. His<strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">7-year contract paid him a decent salary of $5 million a year</a>,</strong> with the possibility of renegotiating in 2009, according to Yahoo Entertainment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/copy-of-untitled-10-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When 2009 came, Ryan Seacrest did exactly that and <strong>received a sizable increase of $15 million</strong>. An increase wasn't an issue for Fox, since Ryan's hosting prowess shot the show's viewers up to 26 million a week. Shortly after signing the deal for his first increase, he <strong>penned another deal with Sony Pictures Television for $45 million</strong>, making him the highest-paid reality television host at the time. However, <a href=#>it's still not more than he earned on Live with Kelly and Ryan</a> after appearing with co-host Kelly Ripa in 2017.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/does-ryan-seacrest-s-wheel-of-fortune-contract-actually-include-a-28-million-yearly-salary-to-be-the-new-host.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Does Ryan Seacrest's Wheel Of Fortune Contract Actually Include A $28 Million Annual Salary To Be The New Host?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ryan Seacrest will host Wheel of Fortune beginning in 2024 and his salary may just be one of the most outrageous in game show history.</span><p>Ryan Seacrest retained his position as the host of American Idol and, according to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he signed a <strong>two-year $30 million deal in 2012</strong>.</a> He reportedly signed another one-year contract in 2014 with the option of signing another one, but the series was canceled in 2016. However, in 2018, he announced that he would be back for an American Idol reboot after <strong>signing a multi-year deal worth $10 million</strong>. Let's see a breakdown of all the deals Seacrest had with American Idol, and how much he made in total:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>2002-2007 Contract at $5 million per year: $35 million</strong></li><li><strong>2009 Sony Pictures Television Contract: $45 million</strong></li><li><strong>2012-2014 Contract at $15 million per year: $30 million</strong></li><li><strong>2017 Reboot Contract: $12 million</strong></li></ul><p>In total, Ryan Seacrest made roughly $120 million from his time as host of American Idol. And he's probably going to make much more, as the salary for his initial contract in 2017 has most likely increased.</p><h2 id=how-much-has-ryan-seacrest-earned-from-deals-with-e-and-nbc>How Much Has Ryan Seacrest Earned From Deals With E! And NBC?</h2><p>Ryan Seacrest has been dubbed as a man who never stops working, and <a href=#>his work ethic is reflected in his $450 million net worth.</a> In 2006, while still fairly new as a host on American Idol, <strong>Seacrest signed a three-year deal worth $21 million with E!</strong>. According to Bustle, for that salary he would be tasked with developing, creating, launching, and hosting a number of programs that would be released by the network. Since then, he's been closely associated with programs such as the Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade, E! Live from the Red Carpet, and E! News.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ryan-Seacrest-Reveals-The-Secret-To-How-The-Kardashians-Really-Got-Started.jpg><p>While Ryan Seacrest still hosts events for E! like E!

But, according to Forbes, Phil McGraw, more widely recognized as <strong>Dr. Phil, earned $79 million in a single year</strong> in 2016, which made him the highest-paid TV host in the world at the time. And, apparently, he still earns an annual salary of $80 million. However, in 2024, the highest-earning TV host is Oprah Winfrey, who draws in an eye-watering $300 million annually, according to Legit. Up next is Ellen DeGeneres, whose annual salary on The DeGeneres Show was $75 million, <strong>putting Ryan Seacrest as the fourth highest-earning TV host of all time.</strong></p><h2 id=how-much-is-ryan-seacrest-expected-to-make-on-wheel-of-fortune>How Much Is Ryan Seacrest Expected To Make On Wheel Of Fortune?</h2><p>Just when fans thought his plate was full, Ryan Seacrest announced in June 2023 that he would be <strong>replacing Pat Sajak as the new host on Wheel of Fortune, and would be making a salary of $28 million.</strong> Pat Sajak has been hosting the show since its inception in 1981, when he took charge of the daytime hosting duties from Chuck Woodley. But according to Katie Couric Media, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's been hinting at retirement for some time now.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ryan-Seacrest-net-worth.jpg><p>Although many would agree that Ryan Seacrest is the man for the job, he was up against some stiff competition for the position. Firstly, the game's hostess, Vanna White, who has been a part of the show since its inception, stepped up to oversee the hosting duties, but was passed up. Pat Sajak's daughter, Maggie Sajak, was also considered, as well as Whoopi Goldberg and Andy Cohen. Goldberg, who has extensive experience as a hostess, was actually floated by the show's producer, J. Chris Newberg, who said the reason behind his decision was because he feared "... It may become too political."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ryan Seacrest Is Worth $450 Million: Here Are 10 Ways He Makes His Money</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>As the man with a million different jobs, you often have to wonder how Ryan Seacrest is able to juggle everything.</span><p>Eventually, Ryan Seacrest stood out as the only worthy candidate and is officially the new host of Wheel of Fortune.
