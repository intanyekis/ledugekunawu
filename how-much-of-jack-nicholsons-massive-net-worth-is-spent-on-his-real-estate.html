He's accomplished so much in his <a href=#>60-year career</a> and has <a href=#>had some of the best roles</a> in Hollywood, including <a href=#>Jack Torrance from The Shining</a>, the <a href=#>Joker from Batman</a>, and the Devil himself in The Witches of Eastwick. During his highly successful career, <a href=#>he's raised five children</a>, one of which is going into the family business. Nicholson's daughter <a href=#>Lorraine is an actress</a> and a filmmaker herself. So it's safe to say that Nicholson has definitely earned his impressive net worth. But what does his real estate portfolio look like?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jack-nicholson-39-s-net-worth-is-400-million>Jack Nicholson's Net Worth Is $400 Million</h2><p>With 79 acting credits spanning over multiple decades, Nicholson truly has an impressive net worth. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Nicholson is worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a whopping $400 million</a>. Most of that money has come from some of Nicholson's most significant roles, which paid him massive paychecks at the time.</p><p>For instance, due to Nicholson's masterly contact-making skills, he earned $50 million from playing the Joker. He agreed to take a $6 million check upfront as long as he could also acquire a portion of the box office. This tends to work in actors' favor. According to Box Office Mojo, Batman earned $400 million, so, in total, Nicholson walked away with $50 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Jack Nicholson And Anjelica Huston Broke Up After 17 Years</a></span></p><p>Nicholson has always been one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood, though. For One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, he earned his first Oscar and a million dollars. Five years later, he starred as Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, which earned him $1.25 million. These salaries might not seem like much today, but they were a lot back then.</p><p>His salaries got better over time. Just Richest reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicholson earned $4 million</a> for Heartburn, $5 million for Ironweed, $10 million for Hoffa, $15 million for As Good as It Gets, and $20 million for Anger Management.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So it's evident that Nicholson has enough money to do whatever he desires. But unlike his fellow celebrities, Nicholson has been smart with his millions for the most part. He's invested an enormous amount of money in real estate.</p><h2 id=jack-nicholson-is-estimated-to-have-a-real-estate-portfolio-worth-more-than-100-million>Jack Nicholson Is Estimated To Have A Real Estate Portfolio Worth More Than $100 Million</h2><p>It is estimated that Nicholson has a real estate portfolio worth a fourth of his own net worth, a total of $100 million. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he owns <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">about a dozen properties</a> in the United States. They know this through his property records.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Does Jack Nicholson Spend His $400 Million Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>He has a long-time primary residence on Mulholland Drive in Beverly Hills. It's more of a multi-property compound spanning three acres. So it's much more than a residence. He bought it in 1969, for just $5 million, and has added to it through the years, especially in 1993 and 2005. The addition he purchased in 2005 was the estate of his friend Marlon Brando.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Work and Money, Nicholson actually demolished Brando's home and planted frangipani flowers in its place as a tribute to Brando's nickname for his longtime home—"Frangipani." When Brando still lived there on Mulholland Drive, as well as Nicholson and fellow celebrity Warren Beatty, down the street, their portion of the famous Los Angeles road was known as "Bad Boy Drive."</p><p>Nicholson has a couple of other homes around Los Angeles too. He has a home in Santa Monica, a condo in Venice, and a 70-acre property in Malibu. His mega Maliba pad went on the market for $4.5 million in 2011, but Nicholson took it off, probably because he was unwilling to sell for lower than his asking price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nicholson's other properties include a house in Shasta County, Northern California, an oceanfront home in Kailua, Hawaii, and he has at least one (perhaps two or three, Celebrity Net Worth guesses) properties in Aspen, Colorado. Nicholson sold a home in Aspen in 2016 for $11 million, just a year after listing it for $15 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Jack Nicholson Quit Acting For Good? Here's What He's Been Up To In 2021</a></span></p><p>Outside of acquiring homes like it's going out of style, Nicholson also collects priceless art. His impressive collection is said to be worth $150 million. He has pieces from artists like Andy Warhol, Jack Vettriano, Henri Matisse, Picasso, Rodin, and Botero. However, Nicholson collects all types of art. He started his collection in the 1960s, so, of course, it would be worth a good chunk of change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So Nicholson has a pretty impressive real estate portfolio, and he has enough art to decorate all of his homes across America. With as much property as Nicholson has, you'd think he'd buy some outside of the states. But that just isn't Nicholson, we suppose. Either way, we're jealous of Nicholson's insane amount of homes.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Movie That Paid Jack Nicholson $166,000 Per Word</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyonWaikZi4brrInJ%2BopKOku7R5zJqqrKGmmnqvsdNmrqiqpJ16qr%2BMrKeepqRivK95x6KqZqqVlrlusdKtmK2dXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
