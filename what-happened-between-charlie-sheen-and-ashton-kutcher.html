"But he had an idea for this character I thought was interesting, and he was like 'Are you ready?' and I was like 'What do you mean?' He's like well 'This is going to be a big story and a big thing.' I was like, 'What's going to happen?' I mean worst-case scenario, the guy is gonna shit-talk me and then what?

"Which I did, I took over Spin City when Michael J. Fox was too sick to work, but no one ever put those two together. … So, I should have been nicer."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He then acknowledged his faults, saying that his pride took over. "He [Kutcher] was tasked with such an uphill struggle and I was more into my own ego than I was aware of his own battle," continued <a href=#>the Ferris Bueller's Day Off star</a>.</p><p>"And for that I am regretful." Around the same time, Sheen also apologized to Rihanna. He wrote: "dear</p><p>@rihanna, pardon my inane self indulgence. let's have a drink someday (on me) ...."</p><p>He previously attacked <a href=#>the Fenty founder</a> after she allegedly snubbed him and his then-fiancée in public."Sorry we're not KOOL enough to warrant a blessing from the Princess (or in this case the Village idiot)," he tweeted at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"See ya on the way down, (we always do) and actually, it was a pleasure NOT meeting you.

"Dude, shut the f--- up! Seriously, like, enough already," he said during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live that year. "It's three years later and you're still blowing me up on Twitter? Come on, dude, really?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Platoon star responded on Twitter, saying: "Ashton message received. so sorry u sounded like me! well done! my bad I was pissed at other crap & took it out on you. hope u r good xox c." But In October 2016, the two appeared to have made up when they ran into each other at a Los Angeles Dodgers game.</p><p>"I forced him into a handshake," Sheen recounted months later. "I said: 'Give me that cup of coffee, young man, and shake my hand.' It was awkward but I made it fine, because I felt bad for him. He thought he was going to catch a right cross, but I just wanted to give him a hug."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmm5iWv621xGaqoZ2Vo3qiusNmmKygpKS7brfUrZqhnaJk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
