Adams and the entertainer first met several years ago and found a mutual connection in the way their Brooklyn roots spilled into their artistry.</p><p>"Over the years Jay has collected and supported my work, and so this collaboration is particularly fulfilling," Adams remarks in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement</a>.</p><p>Adams has grown a mountainous amount of recognition from the art world from his emotionally immersive painting depicting the joys of African American heritage.</p><p>"With this NFT project, we jointly embrace the opportunity to further the conversation about how artists of different mediums contribute to a more inclusive society," he continues, "Jay’s album <i>Reasonable Doubt</i> changed the game 25 years ago, and continues to influence so many of us.

After a failed auction, Dash found himself with a lawsuit. Though Dash proclaimed that the lawsuit was littered with inaccurate information, the judges final decision went in the favor Jay-Z. Just weeks before this incident, the rapper filled another lawsuit against photographer &nbsp;Jonathan Mannion in another likeness dispute.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The current bidding for Heir to the throne stands at a whopping $26,000 and closes on July 2nd.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>"Charlie Bit My Finger" Becomes NFT, Sells For Nearly $1 Million</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> ,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sotheby's</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3osWMs2SnnqRiv6at0qilmpqcmnqlu9Sbq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
