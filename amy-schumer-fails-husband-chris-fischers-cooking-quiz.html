In a previously unaired clip from the second season of her titular Food Network show, Amy Schumer Learns to Cook, star Amy Schumer hilariously fails an impromptu quiz from her husband and cohost, Chris Fischer.
“Pop Quiz! #amyschumerlearnstocook @foodnetwork,” Schumer, 39, captioned an Instagram clip of her evaluation on Saturday, August 22. The video begins with Fischer, 40, asking his wife how to “dredge” something. In cooking, dredging is when you lightly coat a food in a dry ingredient, such as flour, cornmeal or breadcrumbs, but Schumer had another idea."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She jokingly guessed that a “chiffonade,” a slicing technique used to cut greens typically meant to garnish a dish, is “someone that sleeps with you, never calls you back and acts like they don’t know you when they see you at the bar” and later suggested you “deglaze” a pan by putting a doughnut in it and scraping the glaze off.</p><p>Additionally, when asked what “mirin” — a Japanese rice wine — is used for, the I Feel Pretty star jokingly conflated the sweet condiment with Marin, the upscale California locale. “Mirin is a county in San Francisco and it’s used to make white people who love biking,” she replied.</p><p>The video, which has more than 810,000 views, and thousands of comments, was clearly a hit with Schumer’s social media followers. Actress <a href=#><strong>Octavia Spencer</strong></a>, who is open about her own <a href=#>obstacles in the kitchen</a>, commented: “We have the exact same cooking challenge.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Season 2 of Amy Schumer Learns to Cook <a href=#>premiered</a> on Monday, August 17. In the episode, Schumer and Fischer, who is a James Beard Award-winning chef, prepared pigs in a blanket, which they served at their <a href=#>February 2018 wedding</a>, frozen hot chocolate, couscous salad and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Amy-Schumer-Hilariously-Fails-Cooking-Quiz-From-Husband-Chris-Fischer-02.jpg><p>The program, which is filmed in Fischer and Schumer’s home, with their nanny, Jane, holding the camera, was renewed for a second season in June. “We are happy to be coming back for a second season because sequels are always the best!” the Trainwreck star said in a statement at the time. “Chris and I are proud to be partnering with Food Network to donate to <a href=#><strong>Colin Kaepernick</strong></a>’s Know Your Rights Camp whose mission is to advance the liberation and well-being of Black and Brown communities through education, self-empowerment, mass-mobilization and the creation of new systems that elevate the next generation of change leaders.”</p><p>Amy Schumer Learns to Cook airs on Food Network Mondays at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZpqlqWLApLTUppyrZZaWtq2%2FjKGsrJqRo7Fur8eroKxllp7ApLTEq6pmm5%2BkuKq6xmaorqGqZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
