The singer and actress, 77, is requesting to be the only conservator of her son’s estate, arguing that he is “substantially unable to manage his financial resources,” according to documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.
 A conservator is “urgently needed… to protect Elijah’s property from loss or injury,” according to the document, even though he is expected to receive trust assets before the end of the year."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The current schedule is for a hearing on a permanent order on March 6, 2024, and a hearing on a temporary order on January 5, 2024.</p><p>After a report surfaced in October claiming that she had hired four men to forcibly remove her son from a New York City hotel room in November 2022, Cher finally spoke out about Elijah’s ordeal and her relationship with her 47-year-old son.</p><p>King asserted this in recently discovered divorce documents that she filed in December of last year.</p><p>Cher responded to the accusations by saying, “That rumor is not true,” but she would not elaborate.</p><p>She did, however, affirm that her son’s addiction problems—which he has been transparent about over the years—were connected to a personal family issue.</p><p>Cher remarked, “I am not suffering from any problem that millions of people in the United States aren’t,” about her son’s protracted battles with drug addiction. “I am a mother. In one way or another, it is my responsibility to try to assist my kids. You go above and beyond for your kids. Being a mother means that you just lend a helping hand whenever you can. However, even amid heartbreak, there is joy—most of the time, all you can do is smile, love your kids, and do your best to be there for them.”&nbsp;</p><p>King, 36, claimed in the court filings that the famous person paid the men to take Allman—whose father is the late rock musician Gregg Allman—out of their hotel room because they were attempting to “reconcile” their marriage and she was worried about her son’s safety.&nbsp;</p><p>King, who goes by Queenie, claimed that they had spent “12 days alone together from November 18-November 30 working on their marriage” in New York at the time of the incident.</p><p>In the documents, she added, “One of the four men who took [Allman]” told her they worked for the Grammy winner.&nbsp;</p><p>Cher insisted that she would be there for her children, no matter what.
