While Hemsworth will reprise the role of Tyler Rake, we can't say for sure he survived as Russo refused to be drawn into revealing whether the events in the upcoming movie take place before or after the 2020 release. It appears he wasn't sure which direction it would go in himself.</p><p>"We’re not committing yet to whether that story goes forward, or backward in time," Russo noted in May after confirming he would be taking charge of the writing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to Collider</a> back in May, the writer revealed Netflix was excited to get the ball rolling on a second part&nbsp;having expressed delight over Extraction's reception.</p><p>Following several months of silence on the sequel's progress, Russo spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ComicBook.com</a> this week and indicated the film is likely to go into production in 2021. At least that's the intention.</p><p>"We're in the script phase right now but we're hoping to shoot that sometime next year," he said. "And then you know, say I'm super excited, Hemsworth's super excited, Netflix is excited so it's really just a function of getting the script done."</p><p>Russo didn't divulge anything where the plot or location are concerned and the uncertainty over whether&nbsp;scripting will move forward or backward still looms. It appears we'll just have to wait for Extraction 2, but we can continue to imagine Rake surviving&nbsp;his potentially fatal gunshot wound.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Wonder Woman 1984 To Debut On HBO Max Alongside Theatrical Release" href=#>Wonder Woman 1984 To Debut On HBO Max Alongside Theatrical Release</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8monGaqpajAsHnEsaurmZOptrC6jGtkqaqfmcKkwMiopWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
