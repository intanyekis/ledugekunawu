His stage name, which originated from his red hair, is not the only term that he is known by. The comedic genius has been gifted with another nickname, 'The Gift of Props'.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/122736bf-d6f6-40e2-a97f-2d771ac47918.jpg><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Things</a>, Thompson fell in love with stand-up after his roommate convinced him to sign up at an open mic night. Since then, he has achieved several feats and appeared on several well-known talk shows such as 'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno', 'Comic Strip Live', 'Late Night With Conan O’Brien', and 'The Late, Late Show with Craig Ferguson'. 'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno' is noteworthy as the hilarious actor was invited 31 times as a guest on the NBC show.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/21d143a3-4bda-446b-9cf7-d93336aff7ee.jpg><p>Thompson has also portrayed different characters from comedy TV shows such as 'Family Guy', 'George Lopez', 'Robot Chicken', and even in 'CSI: Criminal Scene Investigation'. His most recent work includes 2021's 'Bar Rescue', a reality TV show described as the "Gordon Ramsay of the bar and nightclub business."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq5OkwbV506GmpqijpLturcqaZJyZoqe8tXnTqKdmqJmYwba%2BxJ1kmqtdnbJurdGroK%2Bdo2KutXnAnaylrF2svLO4w2aqraeimnqquoylmKxlppq0or8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
