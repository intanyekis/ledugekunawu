Could Nicole Kidman's life be any more envy-inducing?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans say yes, it could be, because of the way she was when they met her. In a forum, fans elaborated on the times they've run into Nicole in public, and the more passionate fans in the group were a little bit disappointed.</p><h2 id=fans-know-nicole-kidman-has-always-been-media-shy>Fans&nbsp;Know Nicole Kidman Has Always Been Media-Shy</h2><p>Fans already knew that Nicole Kidman was a very private person. Following the dissolution of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her marriage to Tom Cruise, Nicole didn't really say much</a>. Instead, she kept quiet about their two adopted children and their 11 years of wedded not-so-bliss.</p><p>And yet, Nicole has a rabid fan following, and the countless films she's appeared in have all earned her piles of awards and accolades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her ability to become just about any character (okay, maybe not&nbsp;any character; fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aren't so sure about her portraying Lucille Ball</a>) has made her something of an enigma.</p><p>So when a fan working at a Starbucks shop got the opportunity to meet and even take a photo with Nicole, the barista was thrilled! And yet, it was almost a letdown to meet Nicole in person.</p><h2 id=what-did-fans-think-of-meeting-nicole-kidman-in-person>What Did Fans Think Of Meeting Nicole Kidman In Person?</h2><p>This just in: celebrities are&nbsp;people. That's essentially the realization that fans came to after discussing their various interactions with Nicole Kidman.</p><p>After all, the fan who met her ran into the starlet in a Starbucks. Not only that, but they saw her in Nashville, where Nicole and Keith maintain one of their many residences.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The Real Reason Nicole Kidman Didn't Attend Her Son's Wedding With Tom Cruise" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Nicole Kidman Didn't Attend Her Son's Wedding With Tom Cruise</a></span></p><p>It was at the Green Hills, Nashville Starbucks that the barista was able to snap a photo with the always-photogenic Kidman. But the question that was really on commenters' minds? What did she&nbsp;order?!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The barista explained that Nicole ordered a tall decaf nonfat cappuccino. And&nbsp;that was what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">surprised fans</a> about Kidman, in person.</p><h2 id=fans-weren-t-thrilled-with-nicole-s-coffee-order>Fans Weren't Thrilled With Nicole's Coffee Order</h2><p>The thing is, a person's coffee order says a lot about them. So fans were almost disappointed to hear that Nicole orders a coffee that they deem sort of boring and nondescript.</p><p>Some fans were "Disappointed but not surprised," while others pointed out that the drink "kinda describes her, really..."</p><p>Though another barista who has also served Nicole says that she's "always very kind," one commenter pointed out that "That is the face of someone who's really unhappy you asked for a photo."</p><p>The bottom line? Meeting Nicole Kidman in person is not as thrilling as meeting another celeb might be. But it's also hard to tell, given her personality, what she's&nbsp;really thinking. Probably 'gimme my Cappucino so I can get home to Keith.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="What Keith Urban Has Said About Meeting His Wife, Nicole Kidman" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Keith Urban Has Said About Meeting His Wife, Nicole Kidman</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrOiutJmqpqxXaKypsDIp55mppmYvK2xjKSgnaWRo3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
