The suspect then proceeded to fire shots from inside the home and began to exit while aiming a gun at the officers.</p><p>A single North Little Rock Police officer then fired at the suspect who went back inside.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The department’s Special Operations Unit and Crisis Negotiation Team was called in to assist and, after setting up a perimeter around the scene, attempted to make contact with the suspect. Once those efforts proved unsuccessful, a SWAT team entered the home, where they discovered the suspect’s body.</p><p>While NLRPD has yet to release the suspect’s name,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>HipHopSince1987</a> has connected Coca-Kazi to the incident, pointing to a cryptic Facebook Live post shared to the rapper’s page around 2:48 a.m. local time on the same day.</p><p>The 39-second clip opens in a darkened room, with light coming in through a window at one point, before the person filming turns on a light, revealing a large item blocking the door from within. The person filming, presumably Coca-Kazi, turns the light back off, then asks, “What you say now?” before stopping the live feed.</p><p>A Twitter user identifying himself as the rapper’s cousin seemingly confirmed that Coca-Kazi (real name Joseph Seriale Smith) had indeed died, in a post shared to the site on Thursday (January 19). “Lost another cousin today,” the individual wrote. “That’s 2 in less than 7 days. This shit brazy. Damn @cocakazi [broken heart emoji].”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lost another cousin today. That’s 2 in less than 7 days. This shit brazy.
