Once I am on stage, it comes more naturally.” He added that he does “love science” but admitted that he’s “definitely not as smart as him [Sheldon].”</p><p>Meanwhile, his the actress who plays his on-screen sister, Reagan Revord, opened up about what it’s like growing up on the show. “There’s this stereotype with child actors that they’re growing up and they don’t have a childhood,” Revord told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Tonight</a> in May 2022. “And that’s not true. This show has changed me for the better. It’s taught me so many things. This show will always be a part of my life and everyone here will be connected. Because of the show, I have a family here.”</p><p>So, is Young Sheldon a twin in real life?
