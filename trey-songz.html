His mother, April, gave birth to him when she was seventeen years old. His mother and stepfather brought him up as a military brat in the United States Army. He had no ambitions of pursuing a career in music as a child because he was bashful and didn’t believe music was a good fit for him.</p><p>Songz first became aware of his singing ability when he was fourteen years old. When he was in high school, his friends and family urged him to participate in performances. During a talent contest in 2000, Troy Taylor made a professional discovery of Songz, which resulted in the signing of a record deal. When Trey graduated from Petersburg High School in 2003, he relocated to New Jersey to begin working on his debut studio album.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Trey Songz’s debut studio album, I Gotta Make It, was released by Atlanta Records in 2005. The album sold 40,000 copies in its first week alone, with a total of 30,000 records sold across the United States. Gotta Go, the final and second single from the album, was an even bigger hit than his debut track Gotta Make It. It was released as the album’s final and second single.</p><p>Trey Day’s next album, Can’t Help But Wait, featured the single “Can’t Help But Wait,” which debuted in the top 20 singles for the first time. Say Aah, another great single from Trey Songz’s third studio album Ready (2009), peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Up until the Grammy nomination in 2008, everything was ready to go. With Bottoms Up, Trey released yet another hit tune, which is now his most successful single to date. His 2012 album ChapterV became his first No. 1 album on the Billboard200 chart, marking the first time he has achieved this feat. Songz continued to release music in the form of singles and albums over several years. When Trigga’s sixth studio album, “Trigga,” was released on the 1st of July, 2014, it was a huge success, selling 105,000 copies in its first week of availability.</p><p>The year 2020 saw the release of songs by Songz, including Back Home, which featured Summer Walker. In response to the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, he also published a song named 2020 Riots: How Many Times, which was titled 2020 Riots: How Many Times. Back Home, Songz’s ninth studio album will be released on October 9, 2020.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth>Net Worth</span></h2><p><strong>Various sources indicate that Trey Songz’s net worth is approximately $12 million.</strong> His music career as a rapper at numerous concerts and music festivals has enabled him to amass a substantial fortune.</p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Trey Songz estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
