I was a bit of a drifter,” he said. “A guy who felt he grew up in something of a vacuum and wanted to see things, wanted to be inspired. I followed that other thing. I spent years f***ing off. But then I got burnt out and felt that I was wasting my opportunity. It was a conscious change… This was about a decade ago. It was an epiphany.”</p><p>Though he may not have name-dropped the former Friends starlet, the depiction of his unhappy past life with Aniston isn’t the first. In 2011, he told Parade magazine, “I spent the ’90s trying to hide out, trying to duck the full celebrity cacophony. I started to get sick of myself sitting on a couch, holding a joint, hiding out. It started feeling pathetic. It became very clear to me that I was intent on trying to find a movie about an interesting life, but I wasn’t living an interesting life myself. I think that my marriage [to Aniston] had something to do with it. Trying to pretend the marriage was something that it wasn’t.”</p><p>Now, <a href=#>one of VIBE’s most lustable</a> is a well-accomplished family man, shacked up with do-gooder actress <a href=# id=auto-tag_angelina-jolie_3 data-tag=angelina-jolie>Angelina Jolie</a>, who can’t stand being away from his brood of ethnically diverse children.</p><p>“I always thought that if I wanted to do a family, I wanted to do it big. I wanted there to be chaos in the house … there’s constant chatter in our house, whether it’s giggling or screaming or crying or banging,” he described of his six kids with Jolie.</p><p>While the daily luxuries of normalcy sometimes escape him, he still prefers the craziness. “Maybe it’s nice to be in a hotel room for a day – ‘Oh, nice, I can finally read a paper.’ But then, by the next day, I miss that cacophony, all that life,” he said.</p><p>Pitt also gushed about his current status with Jolie. “I have a handful of close friends and I have my family and I haven’t known life to be any happier. I’m making things. I just haven’t known life to be any happier.”</p><p>Read an excerpt of the story <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>.</p><p>Photo Credit: Esquire</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e%2ForCMqaCtrF2ouaK50maYp6GjqbyvecyaqauhkZyybrzRmqCsnaNis6K5yKWwZqSZm7Jurc2gnKWhnpZ6q7vLopxmaWVsf3KFjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
