The clementine story is irrelevant.”</p><p class=p1>Zanab and Cole, 27, <a href=#>got engaged during Love Is Blind season 3</a>. After a rocky journey together, the flight attendant <a href=#>chose to call off their nuptials</a> during the finale, which aired earlier this month.</p><p class=p1>“I tried to be very clear at the altar [about] exactly why I was leaving and why it was a no,” <a href=#>she exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i>ahead of the season 3 finale</a>. “It was deflected to me having a bad attitude and not being sweet enough and not having fun conversations, [being] passive aggressive. My mental health was questioned. So, I definitely did try [to tell him].”</p><p class=p1>Zanab doubled down on her breakup reasoning during <a href=#>an appearance on the season 3 reunion</a>, which dropped on Netflix on Wednesday, November 9, as <a href=#>she accused Cole of body-shaming her</a> throughout their relationship.</p><p class=p1>“The pushing food away from me, the asking me if I’m going to eat that, trying to get me to order a salad, the daily comments about my face and my body were not used,” Zanab <a href=#>claimed during Wednesday’s episode</a>, noting it was her ex’s “saving grace” that a bunch of footage was not shown. “And that’s great because it really did protect you and you are now denying it and calling me a liar in front of all these people.”</p><p class=p1>While Cole denied her claims, Alexa stood by her pal.</p><p class=p1>“I think so many things happened off camera. He’s, like, likable when you’re watching it and just knowing what I know … it’s hard because I think Zay is such an incredible, incredible woman,” Alexa — who <a href=#>married <strong>Brennon Lemieux</strong> during the season 3 finale</a> — told hosts <a href=#><strong>Nick Lachey</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Lachey</strong></a> during the reunion.</p><p class=p1>Zanab went on to detail one particular disagreement, in which Cole seemingly questioned her intentions to eat two clementines. Netflix aired the deleted scene during the finale, which<a href=#> prompted viewers to criticize Zanab’s interpretation of events</a>. The Texas-based realtor has since continued to maintain her version of the story, writing via Instagram on Thursday that <i>Love Is Blind </i>fans have “different triggers” than she does.</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Colleen Reed</strong></a>, who <a href=#>married <strong>Matt Bolton</strong> during the season 3 finale</a>, also chimed in, noting she “forever” stands with her pal.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Cole has not publicly addressed the fallout from the cuties controversy, though he does feel remorse that his actions <a href=#>affected Zaneb’s self-worth</a>. “I sure hope I didn’t shatter her self-confidence,” <a href=#>he told <i>Us</i> before the finale dropped</a> on the streaming platform. “But, for sure, I see where she’s coming from and … why she would’ve felt that way.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to see how the <i>Love Is Blind </i>ladies are supporting Zanab:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkubDCxGagrGWSobavsNJmmKWdqJZ6pLvLpZyepl2ivLOxjJ2cn52emXq7rc2amWaZnZ6xbq%2FOpZxmnKKWuqJ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
