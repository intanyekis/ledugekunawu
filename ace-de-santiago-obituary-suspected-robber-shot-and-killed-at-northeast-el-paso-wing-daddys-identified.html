An aggravated robbery at Wing Daddy’s in northeastern El Paso claimed the life of Ace, a 24-year-old man.</p><p>At 12:19 a.m., his life was cut short in the 11100 block of Sean Haggerty. A native of El Paso, Texas, Ace Isaac De Santiago entered the world on February 15, 1999. He loved his family and friends like a son and a brother. Ace was able to put people at ease with his charisma and attractive demeanor.</p><p>Those fortunate enough to have known him will always remember his contagious laugh and his boundless enthusiasm for life. Ace’s loved ones will always remember him for more than the tragic circumstances of his death. He was a young man whose life was brutally cut short before he could achieve his goals and desires.</p><p>He was devoted to his family and friends and had a deep appreciation for music and the arts. The loss caused by Ace’s untimely passing is immeasurable, and the resulting sadness is overwhelming. His life may have ended tragically, but who he was before that night should not be forgotten.</p><p>The people who knew him will always cherish the memories of the love and happiness he brought into their lives. Those who knew and loved Ace Isaac De Santiago will miss him dearly. Let us remember the value of sympathy, tolerance, and solidarity as we share in the sorrow of his loss.</p><p>His passing should be a somber reminder of the fleeting nature of life and the importance of cherishing every moment spent with those we care about. There will be a memorial service for Ace for friends and family to gather to share memories, condolences, and comfort in the wake of their loss.</p><p>Donations to a local charity or organization that helps the less fortunate would be much appreciated by Ace’s family in lieu of flowers. The light of Ace Isaac De Santiago’s personality will remain in our hearts forever, and he will be sorely missed. I pray that he finds everlasting peace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZK6ksYydnGarkaPBqq3GqGSompmpwqK%2B2GaqrqugmrC1scNmqaiakpq%2Fbr%2FHqKtmmZ6Zeqy1y6WcnWWRqXqvu9Gtn56Zo6l6priMqZisp12stq%2BzjJ2YnZypqHqqsMSnq6KemZqxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
