"The decision to separate is mutual and occurred five months ago. They request privacy at this time," their representative told People at that time.

But as of this writing, there has been no confirmation on whether Wesley and de Ramon's divorce has been finalized yet.</p><p>Wesley was previously married to his Killer Movie co-star, Torrey DeVitto from 2011 to 2013. Before de Ramon, <a href=#>he also dated Phoebe Tonkin</a>.

They were seen meeting other A-listers like Cindy Crawford and her husband Rande Gerber, as well as Sean Penn. At that time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told People</a> that the two had been seeing each other "for a few months" and that a mutual friend introduced them to each other.</p><p>The insider added that de Ramon "is very nice" while Pitt was "really into her." However, they noted that they were just having fun. "It's not an exclusive relationship," said the anonymous tipster. "Ines is cute, fun and energetic. She has a great personality. Brad enjoys spending time with her."</p><p>On Valentine's Day this year — possibly days before she and Wesley filed for divorce — Pitt sent the jewelry designer a large bouquet of pink peonies. They also had a romantic date night in Paris ten days later. In July 2023, someone close to the couple said that they're "going very strong."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They truly enjoy each other's company and are very into each other," they told People.

However, none of them ever met his kids. "He's dated a few women over the years but hasn't introduced any of his children to them," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told Us Weekly</a> early in October 2023.</p><p>That includes de Ramon despite them spending "almost all their free time together" and her becoming "very close" with the <a href=#>Fight Club star</a>'s "inner circle of friends." The insider then clarified that while "things between them are going great," Pitt still hasn't introduced his kids to Ines."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They clarified, "It's not that he doesn't love Ines, it's just that he wants to ensure this relationship is going the distance before he takes that major step." Well, we'll have to see if they'll make it to their first anniversary next month. But so far, the two have been each other's great confidantes during their own divorce battles.</p><p>"Brad has been really supportive of Ines while she's going through her divorce because he understands how it can be," someone told the magazine in February. "Although Brad knows Ines is completely independent and can handle things on her own, he's let her know that she can always open up to him about anything."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In July, another source said, "It's widely known that Brad is dealing with a lot of legal drama but Ines's feelings for him haven't wavered whatsoever. If anything, it's only made their connection stronger in a lot of ways because they're very open and honest when it comes to communication about their lives, whether it be the good or the bad times."</p><p>Meanwhile, there are reports that <a href=#>Jolie has been interfering with Pitt's reconciliation with their eldest son Maddox</a>. He also has a <a href=#>complicated relationship with the rest of his children</a> with whom he only hangs out privately at home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBurtGam2aomanBtHnNnq5mn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWWZo7K0ecOeZKuZnaS7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
