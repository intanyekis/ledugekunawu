Her attorney said the siblings’ mother, Trizah Morris, has “<a href=#>been trying to assert</a> these bogus claims against Ms. Haddish for several years.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also released a statement on her Instagram account. While she didn’t admit to the molestation allegations, Tiffany expressed regret for participating in the sketch videos. “I know people have a bunch of questions. I get it. I’m right there with you,” she wrote.</p><p>“But, clearly, while this sketch was intended to be comedic, it wasn’t funny at all — and I deeply regret having agreed to act in it,” Tiffany continued.</p><p>However, just this week, it was reported that the plaintiff had withdrawn the lawsuit. The sister—whose identity has not been revealed – also released a statement defending Tiffany.</p><p>“<a href=#>My family and I have known Tiffany Haddish</a> for many years – and we now know that she would never harm me or my brother or help anyone else do anything that could harm us,” she stated.</p><p>"We wish Tiffany the best and are glad that we can all put this behind us,” the Jane Doe added.</p><p>Now, Tiffany has spoken out following the lawsuit’s dismissal. Though she may no longer be facing legal repercussions, the actress says she’s lost out on countless job opportunities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paparazzi for <a href=#>TMZ</a> caught up with Tiffany at LAX on Wednesday and questioned her about the dropped case. “She tells our photog she's lost everything in the wake of this,” the publication reports.</p><p>“Another photog asked how she was feeling now that the saga is over […] and she said she was relieved,” it continued. “Noting her main concern here was the actual accuser herself, as well as her brother.”</p><p>Tiffany didn’t expand on what opportunities she’s missed out on since the lawsuit. Known for roles in films like Girls Trip and The Card Counter, the comedian has a reported net worth of $6 million.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Drops $70 Million Just To Move Close To Kanye</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, <a href=#>Variety</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqrLFmqWyZZiWsaW10qGqZqSRrMC2tdNmrpqrXZm%2FsLzPnptmmqWpeqmx0WaamqqVmr9utdJmq6iskaG5unnOr5yrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
