Arnold, 18, shared what life is like on the road via a TikTok video on Wednesday, January 17. Arnold kicked off the clip by showing the bus driver’s seat and explained the pros kept most of their luggage in a storage space beneath the vehicle.
“Then we’ve got our living space,” she said while panning to the room, which featured a hardwood floor, a leather couch and a kitchenette complete with a sink, coffee maker and toaster."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Elsewhere in the video, Arnold showed the mini fridge and microwave on deck.</p><p>Next, Arnold gave fans a glimpse of the DWTS pros’ dining area, which had a small table with attached cup holders and two booth style seats. She moved fans to a small bathroom next before sharing her sleeping area.</p><p>Toward the back of the bus, there are eight bunks set up for the cast. Arnold then zoomed in on hers, which she decorated with a white comforter, a fuzzy green blanket and a peachy silk pillowcase. All the beds were complete with a curtain for privacy.</p><a title=@ryleearnold href=#>@ryleearnold</a><p>Much requested tour bus tour 😘🥰🤭</p><p><a title="♬ original sound - Rylee Arnold" href=#>♬ original sound – Rylee Arnold</a></p><p>“This is the very back,” Arnold said while showing the room that celebrity guests sleep in. “There are no celebs on our bus right now, so we’ve got bags … we call this the junk bunk,” she explained, adding that the dancers clean the room out whenever a celebrity guest from the most recent season joins the tour.</p><p>Arnold concluded the video by blowing a kiss to the camera. “Much requested tour bus tour 😘🥰🤭,” she captioned the post. Sister <strong>Lindsay Arnold</strong>, who danced on the show from 2013 through 2020, pointed out that she and Rylee chose the same bunk.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Omg that was my same bunk spot on my last tour 🥰 good choice,” she commented. Lindsay, 30, served as a pro during season 16 of the show before performing as a troupe member. Two years later, in 2015, she returned as a pro and later won season 25 of DWTS in 2017 with actor Jordan Fisher. She continued as a pro until season 29 when she got pregnant with daughter Sage, now 3, whom she shares with husband <strong>Sam Cusick</strong>. The couple also welcomed daughter June in May 2023.</p><p>Rylee recently concluded her first season as a pro in December 2023. For season 32, she was partnered with <strong>Harry Jowsey</strong>. The duo made it to week 9 of the show before getting eliminated. <strong>Xochitl Gomez</strong> and <strong>Val Chmerkovskiy</strong> went on to win the Len Goodman Mirrorball trophy.</p><p>She’s <a href=#>currently touring with</a> other pros including <strong>Brandon Armstrong</strong>, <strong>Alan Bersten</strong>, <strong>Daniella Karagach</strong>, <strong>Pasha Pashkov</strong>, <strong>Gleb Savchenko</strong>, <strong>Britt Stewart</strong> and <strong>Emma Slater</strong>. Chmerkovskiy, 37, is expected to join the tour this month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmypJWaeqK%2BzaijnWWXnsOmv4ytpq6qXaSzbrDAp5qippdixKrAx2aroZ1dqMGivtJmq6itomKvtr%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
