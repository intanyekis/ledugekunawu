She changed everyone's mind when she starred alongside Tilda Swinton and Chloe Grace Moretz in Suspiria, a 2018 remake of a 1977 classic about a ballet student enrolled in an academy shrouded in a supernatural horror conspiracy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnson wowed audiences with her performance and earned critical acclaim.&nbsp;The range she showed in this role proved just how much potential she has and why she should be taken seriously.</p><h2 id=winning-the-robert-altman-award><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Winning The Robert Altman Award</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-cast-of-suspiria-including-tilda-swinton-chloe-grace-moretz-and-dakota-johnson-at-the-independent-spirit-awards.jpg><p>Piggybacking off of that last entry, Suspiria not only rewarded Dakota Johnson with countless rave reviews giving kudos to her performance, but also with a prestigious award. Still being relatively new to the limelight, Johnson still has yet to crack many major awards, but the biggest award she's received yet is the Robert Altman Award.</p><p>Named after the legendary, late Oscar-nominated director, it's the Independent Spirit Awards' way to honor an ensemble cast filled with exquisite performances. Johnson shares this award with all of her cast members.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wounds><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Wounds</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/armie-hammer-caresses-dakota-johnson-while-she-stares-at-a-laptop-in-the-film-wounds.jpg><p>Adding to her resume of serious, complicated dramas on her resume, Dakota Johnson also starred in Wounds. Johnson stars alongside The Social Network's Armie Hammer, who plays a bartender whose life spirals into a series of unfortunate events once he goes home with a phone that doesn't belong to him in this psychological thriller.</p><p>Admittedly, with a 52% approval rating on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film received mixed reviews from fans and critics criticizing it for a story that isn't creepy enough for its genre, but one consistent praise has been directed towards the talented cast, specifically for the work put in by Johnson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=peanut-butter-falcon><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Peanut Butter Falcon</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shia.jpg><p>Released last year, The Peanut Butter Falcon stars Zack Gottsagen as Zak, a young man with Down Syndrome who runs away from his living facility in hopes of training to become a professional wrestler.

She ventured into the music world by directing a music video for Coldplay's latest single off of their Everyday Life album, called "Cry Cry Cry."</p><p>Fun fact: she actually co-directed the music video with her real-life boyfriend, who happens to be the lead singer of Coldplay: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Martin.</a></p><h2 id=launching-her-own-production-studio><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Launching Her Own Production Studio</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dakota-johnson-e1591884752873-1280x720.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As she made abundantly clear with her directorial debut, Dakota Johnson will not just stick to acting. In fact, she chooses to go one step further by stepping into the producer's chair. Last October, Dakota Johnson officially launched her own movie production company which she calls TeaTime Studios.</p><p>She will be working attentively on creating TV shows and movies with former Netflix exec Ro Donnelly. She is already kicking things in high gear by taking up numerous new projects as the hot new producer in Tinseltown.</p><h2 id=executive-producing-her-first-show><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Executive Producing Her First Show</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fifty-shades-dakota-johnson.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among those new projects is a TV show coming to Amazon Prime, called Rodeo Queens.

Rodeo Queens will also be directed by Portlandia's Carrie Brownstein.</p><p>In addition to executive producing the show, Johnson will lead an ensemble cast that has yet to be determined but expect a star-studded line-up willing to work with the Fifty Shades star.</p><h2 id=having-a-fence-chat-with-jimmy-kimmel><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Having A Fence Chat With Jimmy&nbsp;Kimmel</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/jimmy-fallon-talks-to-dakota-fanning-from-behind-a-fence-for-a-talk-show-segment.jpg><p>One of the stranger things which Dakota Johnson has done in her post-Shades life is conduct an interview with real-life neighbor Jimmy Kimmel in between a fence bordering their homes. To be fair, just about everything that has been filmed for television this year during the novel coronavirus pandemic has been strange, but this may be especially the case in the late-night TV world where hosts struggle to produce content from the comfort of their homes without a live audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this case, we saw Johnson interviewed by next-door neighbor Jimmy Kimmel, during which Johnson wore a Disney princess dress for no particular reason at all.</p><h2 id=working-with-maggie-gyllenhaal-and-olivia-wilde><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Working With Maggie Gyllenhaal And Olivia Wilde</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Olivia-Wilde-via-people.com_.jpg><p>In addition to her producing efforts, Johnson continues to line up work as an actress.
