When I went back to <b>Riften</b> to attend my wedding, I noticed that Rayya was in attendance too… she sat in a pew and left after the ceremony was done. I didn’t have the time to talk to her, because I had to talk to Lydia about where to live.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-steward-choice-matter></span>Does steward choice matter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>5 Answers. <b>None of the characters make a “better” steward</b>; they all behave exactly the same in that role. They also still work as followers: you can still ask them to follow you again, marry them, etc. The only thing that changes when you make a follower a steward is where they hang out when they stop following you.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-faendal-be-a-steward></span>Can Faendal be a steward?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Steward. With the addition of Hearthfire, Faendal is one of the followers that can become a <b>steward for one</b> of the Dragonborn’s homes.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-rayya-a-good-wife></span>Is Rayya a good wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Rayya makes a solid follower and spouse</b>, especially for players who need a tank-like companion. Moreover, Rayya’s an essential character, meaning she can’t actually die unless the Dragonborn lands the final blow.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-get-rayya-as-housecarl></span>How do you get Rayya as housecarl?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Rayya is a Redguard warrior found in the Jarl’s Longhouse in Falkreath. She becomes your personal housecarl <b>when you have earned the title of Thane in Falkreath Hold</b>. She wears a set of steel armor and an Alik’r hood.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-better-faendal-or-lydia></span>Who is better Faendal or Lydia?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Better melee than Faendal</b>, though his archery is only 28 compared to Faendal’s 35. Lydia and Uthgerd are both 22 Archery. If you want unarmored/female, maybe try Annekke. She’s got a 26 archery and is still better at melee than Faendal.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-i-lie-to-camilla-in-skyrim></span>Should I lie to Camilla in Skyrim?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Helping yourself. Both Faendal and Sven can be pickpocketed for the letters, and both can be given to Camilla either via lying that each is from the other, or by telling the truth. She will offer no unique dialogue in either case.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-faendal-a-good-follower></span>Is Faendal a good follower?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If players choose to side with Faendal instead of Sven, they still won’t be getting a great deal in the end when it comes to followers. … Beyond this helpful loophole though, Faendal has little in the way of benefits that <b>make him better than other followers in the game</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-j-zargo-a-good-follower></span>Is J Zargo a good follower?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>J’Zargo. … Bizarrely, J’Zargo has <b>the highest HP stat of any companion</b>, which is a bit strange when you compare him to tanks like Farkas and Frea. He only uses Apprentice level spells, which can be a bit of a nuisance given how high his stats are, but he’s still a powerful companion and a great character to boot.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-vorstag-a-good-follower></span>Is Vorstag a good follower?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Vorstag is a Nord warrior living in Markarth at the Silver-Blood Inn.

J’zargo is the best punch-kitty. In fact, if you give J’zargo good heavy-armour gloves enchanted with this on J’zargo’s ring and gloves, J’zargo will do a lot of damage.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-jzargo-use-better-spells></span>Can Jzargo use better spells?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>J’zargo is the best mage follower (opinion) in the game because <b>he does not use higher level spells than needed at lower levels of play setting</b>. This is where the difference comes in.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-j-zargo-level-cap></span>What is J Zargo level cap?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>J’zargo is one of only two Khajiit followers available in the game, the other being Kharjo. J’zargo is one of the few followers who has no maximum level. He will continue to level up with you. This issue has been addressed by version 1.0 of the Unofficial Skyrim Patch; he will now cap at <b>level 30</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-j-zargo-be-a-steward></span>Can J Zargo be a steward?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Unlike Onmund and Brelyna Maryon, <b>J’zargo cannot become a steward or be married</b>. If J’zargo is made a Blade, and is told to part ways, he will still say “Really?<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-inigo-skyrim></span>Who is Inigo Skyrim?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Inigo is <b>a follower mod</b> for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition that adds a fully-voiced Khajiit follower. Inigo can be found in the Riften Jail, where he will occupy the prison cell next to Sibbi Black-Briar.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-serana-a-good-follower-skyrim></span>Is serana a good follower Skyrim?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>As an essential character, she cannot die, which makes her an excellent choice as <b>a companion</b>. Her aggressive behavior can make sneaking difficult, but since she can’t die, Serana makes a great decoy. High stats in sneak, one-handed, and light armor mean she is effective even when out of Magicka.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-make-mjoll-the-lioness-a-steward></span>Can you make Mjoll the lioness a steward?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Dragonborn may offer to retrieve it for her; if this objective is completed, Mjoll becomes a potential spouse. She can also be recruited as a follower, and if Hearthfire is installed, can <b>be made a steward at one of the Dragonborn’s properties</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-have-two-stewards-in-skyrim></span>Can you have two stewards in Skyrim?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Yes, <b>you can have a different steward for each house</b>. You sort of have to have a different steward in each house if you want to have one constantly in each house.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-skyrim-followers-are-essential></span>Which Skyrim followers are essential?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Seven permanent followers are essential as well: Derkeethus (due to a bug), <b>Mjoll</b>, two Dark Brotherhood Initiates, Cicero, SeranaDG and Frea DB are essential.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-marry-rayya-in-skyrim></span>Can you marry Rayya in Skyrim?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Rayya can be <b>asked to become a steward for a homestead in Hearthfire</b>. She is also a candidate for marriage.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-marry-a-skaal></span>Can you marry a Skaal?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Marriage. After the Dragonborn has freed the Skaal and helped Morwen deliver her mother’s amulet to Runil in Falkreath, she will be a candidate for marriage.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46iqmaqka7GonnAZp6op5RiwLWx1pqpnWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
