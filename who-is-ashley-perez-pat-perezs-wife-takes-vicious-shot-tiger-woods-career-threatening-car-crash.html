In the video, the golf legend can be seen explaining his struggle with recovery post-accident, but it seems Ashley had no sympathy for the star.&nbsp;</p><p>In the comments of the post, Ashley wrote, "Literally why driving under the influence is ILLEGAL. I don't feel bad for him. Thank god he didn't kill anyone. See ya." The comment has since been deleted but the screenshots were saved by several users. The <a href=# rel>15-time major champion</a> could be heard saying, "I can hit golf balls. It's the walking that just hurts,' in a clip from the press conference prior to the tournament." The <a href=# rel>golf veteran</a> continued, "The goal is to play just the major championships and maybe one or two more. I mean, that's physically all I can do … I don't have much left in this leg, so gear up for the biggest ones and hopefully lightning catches in a bottle, and hopefully I'm up there with a chance to win, and hopefully I remember how to that."</p><p>Woods will now be seen with <a href=# rel>Rory McIlroy</a> against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas at The Match.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Tiger Woods vs Saudi Arabia: How the greatest golfer ever is leading PGA fight against regime-backed rebel tour</a></p><p><a href=# rel>LIV offered Tiger Woods $800 MILLION to join them, here's where he told them to stick it</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Ashley Perez?</h2><p>Not much is known about Ashley Perez. Aside from being the wife of Pat Perez, the winner of the PGA Tour event in 2009 and 16th in 2018 in the Official World Golf Ranking, Ashley is a professional inventive engineer and designer. The duo met while attending a dinner party in Las Vegas and tied the knot in 2015, and are blessed with two children - Piper Perez and Paxton Perez. Ashley has a massive following on Instagram with 408,000 followers but has a private account. According to her bio, she is also an artist and a pianist.&nbsp;</p><p>Ashley's husband Pat has also tackled Tiger Woods in the past when he made strong comments on golfers joining LIV Golf, saying the players are only doing it for the money with no motivation of actual labor. Perez told the Son of a Butch podcast, "That's one of the stupidest things I think he has said. The incentive is the fact that last place is 120,000, first place is four million. You cannot win four million on the PGA Tour. Now, next year you might; they finally got the perks. But last time I checked, he signed a $40million deal right out of college, was flying on the Nike jet. He found incentive. He could have shut it down right then."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjJqqoaSVrnqxsdGesWaokal6sbHRnrGsZaees6Z505qinqtdq7aktc6uqmarmKTBbsDIoJyrZaekvKW%2FjJyYq52Vp3q1tNGemK2dnp67qHnCmqlmm6KWwKk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
