The figure bumps all the way up to $24.5 million in the 2021 season.</p><p>Many expected the Titans and Tannehill to agree on a new deal even sooner, but the deal was finally closed out just three days before the scheduled start of free agency. Now, the team can focus on retaining Pro Bowl running back Derrick Henry. The franchise tag looks likely for the latter, now that Tannehill is locked up long-term.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tannehill pulled off an incredible comeback story for the ages in 2018. He replaced starter Marcus Mariota in Week 6 last season, and the rest is history. Tannehill won seven of 10 starts, completing 70.3 percent of his passes for 2,742 yards and 22 touchdowns against just six interceptions.</p><p>The magic was only beginning, however.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patriots Offered Tom Brady Less Than The $23 Million He Made In 2019 [Rumor]</a></strong></p><p>Tannehill and the Titans upset the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots in the Wild Card Round, perhaps ending the Tom Brady era.

But it was still an extremely successful season for Tennessee, who went from complete afterthought in the AFC South to conference runner-ups.</p><p>There will be plenty of doubts about the 2019 Comeback Player of the Year repeating his 2019 success. But the Titans clearly feel confident in Tannehill's ability to take them to the next step.
