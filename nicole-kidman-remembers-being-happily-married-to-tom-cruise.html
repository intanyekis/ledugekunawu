Nicole Kidman opened up about her marriage to Tom Cruise — and revealed that she doesn’t want to dwell on any “negative feelings.”
The Australian actress, 53, reflected on her time filming Eyes Wide Shut with Cruise, 58, and late director Stanley Kubrick. Kidman met her now-ex in November 1989, and the duo wed one month later. Despite the long days and taxing emotional scenes in Kubrick’s 1999 erotic drama, in which Kidman and Cruise played a married couple working through infidelity, the Big Little Lies star only remembers the best of the experience."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Despite the long days and <a href=#>taxing emotional scenes</a> in Kubrick’s 1999 erotic drama, in which Kidman and Cruise played a married couple working through infidelity, the <a href=#>Big Little Lies</a> star only remembers the best of the experience.</p><p>“We were <a href=#>happily married</a> through that,” she told <a href=#>The New York Times</a> in an interview published on Monday, October 5. “We would go go-kart racing after those scenes. We’d rent out a place and go racing at three in the morning. I don’t know what else to say. Maybe I don’t have the ability to look back and dissect it. Or I’m not willing to.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nicole-Kidman-Remembers-Being-Happily-Married-to-Tom-Cruise.jpg><p>Before their 2001 split, Kidman and the Top Gun actor adopted two children, daughter <a href=#><strong>Isabella</strong></a>, now 27, and son <a href=#><strong>Connor</strong></a>, now 25. During their long hours together on the Eyes Wide Shut set, <a href=#>coming home to their kids</a> at the end of the day helped the former couple return to reality.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We loved working with [Kubrick],” the Bewitched actress explained. “We shot that for two years. We had two kids and were living in a trailer on the lot primarily, making spaghetti because Stanley liked to eat with us sometimes. We were <a href=#>working with the greatest filmmaker</a> and learning about our lives and enjoying our lives on set. We would say, ‘When is it going to end?’ We went over there thinking it was going to be three months. It turned into a year, a year and a half. But you go, ‘As long as I surrender to what this is, I’m going to have an incredible time.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nicole-Kidman-Remembers-Being-Happily-Married-to-Tom-Cruise-Eyes-Wide-Shut.jpg><p>Five years after he and Kidman called it quits, the Jerry Maguire star wed <a href=#><strong>Katie Holmes</strong></a>. The pair share a 14-year-old daughter and were married for six years before Holmes, 41, filed for divorce. Kidman, for her part, tied the knot with <a href=#><strong>Keith Urban</strong></a> in June 2006 and welcomed <a href=#>two daughters</a>, Sunday, 12, and Faith, 9.</p><p>“She’s just the one. She’s the one that I was<a href=#> searching for my whole life</a>,” the country singer, 52, said of his wife on an episode of <a href=#><strong>Dax Shepard</strong></a>‘s “Armchair Expert” podcast in September. “It felt so obvious. … [She] was everything I was looking for and then beyond. Just beyond.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZOkuaZ5yqKbppmeYr%2BmucSmmZ6qo2KvprXNoGShmaCltq3FjKaYq6qZmrFuwM5mq6ilXZi%2FtrXSnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
