Upon leaving the villa in Mexico, he found himself diving headfirst into the unknown world of fame. His following had increased by millions, and the star now had over 4 million followers at his fingertips, a significant increase in comparison to his previous follower count before joining the show.</p><p>However, even before appearing on Too Hot To Handle, the star had already had a little taste of fame across the Pacific in his home country of Australia. Jowsey had previously made an appearance on an Australian dating show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heartbreak Island</a>, where he won the $100,000 cash prize with his partner at the time, Georgia Bryers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both of these reality TV appearances helped Jowsey to grow in popularity and fame, as well as increase his online presence via social media.

Much of this is thanks to his newfound fame from appearing on Too Hot To Handle, which has allowed him to heavily monetize his Instagram and other social media platforms to his advantage. The much-loved reality TV star currently has 4.4 million followers on Instagram as of 2022, as well as enjoying a particularly high engagement rate on the platform, racking up hundreds and thousands of likes on the platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With such a large pool of fans at his fingertips, Jowsey can easily demand up to five figures for a single sponsored post on Instagram. Even more shocking is the reported amount he's earned off the platform so far, with estimated figures being calculated at $562,062 dollars as of 2021.</p><p>This is a staggering amount considering he starred on Too Hot To Handle only a year prior. In addition, he also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has his own podcast on YouTube</a>, which brings him some spare income each month.</p><p>In previous interviews, Jowsey has <a href=#>mentioned that he would be interested in doing another reality TV show</a> sometime in the future, which could potentially give a boost to his net worth if it is something the star decides to pursue.
