Once inside the 12-foot-tall double front doors, six bedrooms and seven baths are spread across almost 6,500 square feet of two-level living space boasting hardwood floors, high ceilings, designer lighting and floor-to-ceiling Fleetwood glass sliding doors throughout.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Open-concept interiors are highlighted by a grand entryway displaying a floating staircase hiding a wine closet underneath, along with a formal dining area that connects to a living room spotlighted by a linear fireplace embedded in a wood accent wall and doors spilling out to a covered terrace ideal for al fresco entertaining. An adjacent gourmet kitchen is outfitted with custom cabinetry, a duo of oversized waterfall-edge quartz islands, high-end Thermador appliances and a walk-in pantry.</p><p>Upstairs, a spacious master retreat comes complete with a marble fireplace, private balcony, two walk-in closets, and a huge bath sporting a standalone wet room hosting a soaking tub and shower; and elsewhere in the house is a movie theater, plus a flex space that could be used as an office or a lounge area. Stealing the show is a turf-clad backyard hosting a zero-edge pool and spa with a Baja ledge, sport court, and barbecue and kitchen setup flanking a fire-pit. There’s also two guesthouses — one that’s currently being used as a gym — plus Control4 automation and solar panel systems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The listing is held by Liz Gottainer and Tori Barnao of Compass.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaanqSav26u1LKgp59dnrtur8ClmJuZo5bAbq3RrJynoZ9itaK4y2ajoqukqHqouMitsbJlpJa%2Fu63NmmSmmZ6otrC6jJ%2Bmq2VlYoBuucilo6KnnmJ%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
