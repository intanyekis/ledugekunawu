He was a cast member of the NBC late-night sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live for eight seasons, running from 2014 to 2022, Pete Davidson, arguably one of Hollywood’s leading if unlikely Lotharios, has unsurprisingly put his waterfront condo in his native borough of Staten Island on the market at a number so close to $1.3 million it might as well be $1.3 million. The listing is jointly held by <a href=#>Amy Arnone</a> and <a href=#>Marissa Polo</a> at <a href=#>The Jason Mitchell Group</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b> All Of Pete Davidson's Girlfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</b></a></span></p><p>On the scrawny side, with pasty skin covered in a jumble of tattoos, the comedian and actor was briefly engaged to Ariana Grande and dabbled in a short romance with Kate Beckinsale before he rocketed to international tabloid superstardom on the arm of reality TV royal Kim Kardashian. Though it’s out of her usual rarefied orbit, Kardashian <a href=#>called</a> Staten Island “amazing,” and business picked up in local eateries and theaters where the couple went on low-key dates. Alas, after much petty feuding and name calling between Davidson and Kardashian’s ex-husband Kanye West, the pair split in October. The seemingly irresistible-to-bombshells jester has quickly rebounded with freshly divorced model and actress Emily Ratajkowski.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As noted by <a href=#><i>The Staten Island Advance</i></a>, the first to suss out the listing in the St. George neighborhood, the asking price is barely above the $1.2 million Davidson paid for the seventh-floor unit two years ago. (The weed aficionado previously lived in the customized basement of his mother’s Staten Island house.) With two bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms, the light-filled corner unit is gussied up medium-brown wood floors, up-lit coved ceiling moldings, and in-ceiling speakers throughout its almost 1,600 square feet.</p><p>Other highlights include a newly remodeled bathroom in the main bedroom, a quartz countertop that waterfalls off the end of the open-plan kitchen’s peninsula snack bar, and a faux-grassed balcony with a hazy view of the lower Manhattan skyline over the busy Staten Island Ferry terminal to one side and a distant view of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge to the other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Somewhat surprisingly painted pale pink, the primary bedroom includes a newly renovated bathroom, fitted walk-in closet and balcony access, while the second bedroom, painted a dusty shade of green, also has an en-suite bathroom, according to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><p>The pet-friendly building, called The Accolade, offers residents 24-hour security, an attended lobby, a clubhouse, a health club, a tennis court, and both indoor and outdoor play areas for children.</p><p>With burgeoning opportunities (he appeared in “Suicide Squad” in 2021 and voiced Marmaduke in the 2022 animated streamer), Davidson ended his eight-season run on “SNL” earlier this year. His slate of upcoming projects includes the ensemble Wall Street bio comedy-drama “<a href=#>Dumb Money</a>,” the stoner comedy “Wizards!”, and a role in the next installment of the “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.”</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>The Staten Island Advance</a>, <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmapnaSaeqWt1aKbrKeeYrmqv9OsZKyskamyr3nIrKOappRisLC6w6hksKCVp7JutMRmq6uxo6mypXnWoquhZZueum63wKubmquYnq6vecWoqWZpXWeGennMoqOloZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
