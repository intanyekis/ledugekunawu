After being in a position of honor that allowed her to interview many of these incredibly talented people, and in many cases, gave her an opportunity to befriend them, she turned on anyone and everyone that she could fire off on. Couric didn't hesitate to spill the tea on what <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a> was really like behind the scenes, and not a single aspect of her story seemed very 'royal' at all.</p><h2 id=katie-couric-spills-all>Katie Couric Spills All</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it was revealed that Katie Couric was releasing a memoir, most presumed it would center around her personal feelings and her career in the spotlight, inclusive of the various ways she was affected by the important people that she was fortunate enough to meet.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>She took a different turn, and instead, Couric used her memoir as a platform to roast some of the people she met, leaving no name guarded, and nothing held sacred. She fired off on her less than impressive experiences with the likes of Martha Stewart, her ex, Tom Werner, and she was even brazen enough to take aim at the late Larry King, with no desire to let him rest in peace.</p><p>Her description of Prince Harry was especially colorful, and Couric used her five minutes of fame to drag him to the best of her ability.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Katie Couric Really Feels About Matt Lauer</a></span></p><h2 id=prince-harry-39-s-true-colors>Prince Harry's True Colors</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Katie Couric showed no shame about exposing her encounter with Prince Harry by depicting him in the worst possible light. Within her memoir, she states that she spent some time really getting to know him in Brazil, during a polo match.</p><p>Rather than being awestruck by his royal presence, Couric indicates that she was severely taken aback by his 'sowing his oats phase,' and went on to describe Prince Harry, but not by using his aesthetic characteristics.</p><p>Instead, she complained about his odor.</p><p>Trolling Prince Harry to the fullest degree, Couric stated that; "the stench of cigarettes and alcohol seemed to ooze from every pore in his body."</p><p>She went on to slam his admission of medicating his pain with alcohol and went all out in slamming his character and making him appear to be a disheveled, completely unruly man with serious issues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Social media isn't impressed and is now pointing the finger back at Couric, asking her why she needed attention so badly that she was willing to strike out against Prince Harry to make her name current when it ought not to be.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Fans Mock ‘Incredibly Sad’ Prince Charles Over Not Meeting Prince Harry And Meghan Markle’s Daughter</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqyZmnqku9SroJxlo6W2rbjSZquhnV2psqJ5zqdksKCRqXqxvsinmp5lmJa%2Fs8WMoqpmqpWWua3FjKWgpJ1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
