However, the actress was seen dining with A-Rod and two others in July 2012. "Though she reportedly brought a stray cat as her date to a party at A-Rod's house later that year," the outlet wrote, "Moore also twerked at the same party, possibly causing her boyfriend, Vito Schnabel, to dump her." Sources told Page Six that back then, Moore actually took the cat with her when she crashed an exclusive Chanel party held at Miami's Art Basel. "The kitten sat on Demi’s lap throughout the meal . . . She was cuddling and petting it," said a witness who saw the cat wandering around the Soho Beach House's pool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After dinner, the Charlie's Angels star left the cat and went to the after-party along with other celebrity guests like Will Ferrell, Stacy Keibler, Karlie Kloss, Adriana Lima, Pharell Williams, and Lenny Kravitz. Spies also claimed that Moore and then-boyfriend, Schnabel were pretty low-key during the event. "Vito and Demi didn't want to be pictured together," said the insider. "They want to keep their relationship as private as possible, and he is determined to be taken seriously in the art world rather than be known as a celebrity."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a pretty wild night for Moore who reportedly went to a pop-up club with Keibler, post-afterparty. "They sat with five guy friends and were dancing together," a source said. "They were offered tequila shots, but Demi declined, saying 'no shots,' while Stacy and her friends happily knocked them back. They left at around 3 a.m., and amazingly, said they wanted to go on to another club." The two reportedly stayed at Rodriguez's Miami Beach Mansion. Keibler is a close friend of A-Rod's "gal pal," Torrie Wilson.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Does Jennifer Garner Feel About Bennifer's Engagement?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-a-rod-dating-now>Who Is A-Rod Dating Now?</h2><p>In January 2022, A-Rod was spotted with his rumored new girlfriend, Kathryne Padgett, 25. The 46-year-old has been spotted with her a few times in public. The former professional baseball player is yet to confirm the relationship, but news outlets have already stalked Padgett. She's apparently a nutrition expert who currently works as the nutritional director at Doyle Sports Performance in Georgia. Originally from Dallas, Texas, Padgett graduated from the University of St. Thomas in 2019 and is currently residing in Beaumont, Texas, per her Facebook.</p><p>Aside from working on her license as a dietitian-nutritionist, Padgett is also an amateur bodybuilder who got into national-level bodybuilding in Texas' NPC Branch Warren Classic (2021). There, she competed in the Bikini level and placed seventh in the class-C category. She also won a title in the 'Wellness' class B category, as well as the True Novice class for the same category. She's also pretty athletic, having played soccer for the University of St. Thomas Women's Soccer team. In 2018, she received the Champions of Character award for her performance. No wonder A-Rod took an interest in her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Demi Moore Cheated On Her First Husband For This Heartbreaking Reason</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-demi-moore-39-s-current-boyfriend>Who Is Demi Moore's Current Boyfriend?</h2><p>In March 2022, it was confirmed that Moore is currently dating <a href=#>New York City restaurateur, Daniel Humm</a>. "Demi met Daniel through mutual friends and they clicked right away," a source told Us Weekly. "He's very charming, loves the finer things in life and is extremely cultured, plus they share the same devilish sense of humor and sense of adventure." The Swiss chef also earned his first Michelin star at the age of 24. He now owns multiple restaurants in NYC and is a co-founder of the NYC-based nonprofit, Rethink Food — an organization that aims to promote "a more equitable sustainable food system."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two seem to be in it for the long haul. Still, Moore has been by Bruce Willis' side amid <a href=#>his recent aphasia diagnosis</a>. "To Bruce's amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities," the actress wrote on Instagram.</p><p>"As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him," she continued. "This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion, and support. We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Truth About Mila Kunis And Demi Moore's Rumored Feud</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdlrmmxIyrpp2qmZzCpsaMnZitnV2Zsq61jKamqKqVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
