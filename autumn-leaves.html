ERIC CLAPTON Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴The falling leaves, drift by my window
The autumn leaves, of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands, I used to holdSince you went away, the days grow long
And soon I'll hear, old winter's song
But I miss you, most of all, my darling When autumn leaves start to fallSince you went away, the days grow long"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The imagery of the falling leaves and red and gold colors evoke a sense of loss and change, setting the tone for the rest of the song. The reference to "summer kisses" and "sun-burned hands" suggest an intimacy between the singer and the subject of the song, perhaps a former lover.</p><br><p>The chorus is where the true emotion of the song resides, with the repetition of the phrase "But I miss you, most of all, my darling when autumn leaves start to fall." The melancholic melody and Clapton's emotive voice convey a longing and sorrow for what once was. The lyrics speak to the universality of loss and the longing for what is no longer present.</p><br><p>Overall, the lyrics to "Autumn Leaves" capture the essence of the changing seasons as a metaphor for life's transitions and the power of nostalgia to evoke powerful emotions.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>The falling leaves, drift by my window</u><br>I observe the leaves falling from the trees and drifting outside my window</p><br><p><u>The autumn leaves, of red and gold</u><br>I notice that the leaves of the trees are colored in shades of red and gold, a sign that autumn is here</p><br><p><u>I see your lips, the summer kisses</u><br>I remember your lips and the kisses we shared during the summer season</p><br><p><u>The sun-burned hands, I used to hold</u><br>I vividly recall the feel of your sun-burned hands that I held in mine</p><br><p><u>Since you went away, the days grow long</u><br>Ever since you left, I sense the days growing longer and more difficult to get through</p><br><p><u>And soon I'll hear, old winter's song</u><br>I know that the season of winter is approaching and soon I will hear its harsh and melancholic tune</p><br><p><u>But I miss you, most of all, my darling</u><br>Out of all the things I miss, I miss you the most, my beloved partner</p><br><p><u>When autumn leaves start to fall</u><br>The time when the leaves begin to fall off the trees, marking the beginning of autumn, is when I feel your absence the most</p><br><p><u>Yes I miss you, most of all, my darling</u><br>Once again, I reiterate that I miss you more than anything else, my dearest one</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC<br>Written by: GIORGIO CANALI, FRANCESCO MAGNELLI, GIANNI MAROCCOLO, MASSIMO ZAMBONI, GIOVANNI LINDO FERRETTI</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maH2CfpCgj6t6h42HfmSOtsDUpqWYhJWWw6a%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
