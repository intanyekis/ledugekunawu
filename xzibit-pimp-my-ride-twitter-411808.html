Speaking with former participants on the show as well as a former executive producer, the news site revealed that the fantasy of tricked-out vehicles were just that: fantasies. While cars were made to look cool on the outside, they very rarely operated well after they were pimped. It was also revealed that contestants’ reactions to their new vehicles were staged, and that some of the “pimped out” featured were removed from cars after the show’s taping.</p><p>After shutting down the “pimp my ride” request, another Twitter user scolded Xzibit, asking why he wasn’t “gracious” to his fans. The rapper called the fan a “troll,” and advised his critic to mind their business:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Xzibit-fan-Tweet.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Xzibit-Tweet-2.png><p>Welp.
