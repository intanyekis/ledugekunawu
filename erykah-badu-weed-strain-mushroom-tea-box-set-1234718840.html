And we each hit it two or three times and we were like comatose. But then, the next time we did the experiment, we each hit it one time and we had such a wonderful experience.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Grown by Mad Cow Genetics, “That Badu” has a “lemon smell” that’s “very faint,” according to the songstress, who recommends it to mothers and women who want to enjoy its effects while remaining productive and alert. “It’s really nice and natural, sort of like a ballad,” Badu describes. “It just makes you move light and it kind of<a href=#> gets you through your day</a> and you’re not zooted.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In addition to her self-named strain, the 51-year-old vanguard was also presented with a mushroom tea box set, which she was gifted <a href=#>the Bay Area rep</a>. The tea box set includes two psilocybin flavors (Ginger Magic, Earl Grey Creme), and two functional flavors (Golden Focus, Bergamot Brain Boost), as well as directions on how to prepare and consume them to maximize the experience.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“These are really for your evenings or meditations or vision quests or evenings when you have an opportunity to commune with your mind,” Badu said of the teas. She also added that they’re “very good for emotional balance,” as well as “any kind of nervous system malfunction or dysfunction.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Dallas native previously released her “Badu Pu**y Premium Incense,” a fragrance she made to smell like her vagina, in 2020. The product famously sold out on her online shopping store within minutes of its availability, but was later restocked.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “That Badu” strain will reportedly be available via <a href=# rel=nofollow>Cookies</a>‘ network of licensed dispensaries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-848023060.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5q%2FurfAoWSbmZSqerixxJ1krKyilravecyuqqGqn6S6bsDEmmSbp6hiwKbAjGppbGxnZoV5gI9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
