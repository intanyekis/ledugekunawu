Being that Bob Ezrin did not have a Twitter account, I decided to give him a voice on a bigger platform but in a more satirical way."</p><p><span>Indeed, Twitter confirmed to<i> Us Weekly </i>this week that Ezrin, 66, is not on the social media platform, although he immediately became a trending topic after West ranted about him on Tuesday, February 23. The <i>Life of Pablo </i>rapper, 38, took to Twitter to blast Ezrin's scathing review of his new album and said the producer's family should be "embarrassed" by him. (Bob Ezrin, who has worked with Phish, Pink Floyd, Kiss and Lou Reed, sent the review via&nbsp;<b>Bob Lefsetz</b>'s popular email newsletter, which expounds about music and the music industry.)</span></p><p>Shortly after West's rant, Platinum took to his verified account and changed his name and profile pic to Ezrin. He figured, though, that people would see the joke — but they didn't.</p><p>"Funny thing is, after a while I noticed people really thought I was Bob, and I was like, OK!" he tells <i>Us.</i> "I guess being someone else for five minutes is more exciting than I remembered, which is the reason I've decided to start pursuing my acting career…. I was surprised! Surprised at how viral my tweets became, and it's truly a testament to the world's love/hate relationship with Kanye West. My goal as an entertainer is to simply keep people entertained, and I accomplished that."</p><p><span>Then, of course, there's the family connection. Platinum is the cousin of West's most outspoken ex-girlfriend Amber Rose. However, this time, the 29-year-old model chose not to get involved — even after West ranted about her at 1 OAK in L.A. this past Tuesday, February 23.</span></p><p>"Amber wasn’t even aware of what was going on," Platinum tells <i>Us.</i> "As I previously stated, it was originally a joke that people latched onto, and it went viral. I took the meaning of 'carpe diem' and seized the day. Amber knows that on social media I like to have fun. [She] was only mentioned in the context of Bob and not as myself. She is her own brand, and I am mine. There is no feud or bad blood. It's all love."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZKav26%2BzqycrGWTpMK0tc1msKitnpx6sbjAraCnrZ1ivK95waiZZp2qp7avecqapbKdXZuytrCMsGhvbWRlhHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
