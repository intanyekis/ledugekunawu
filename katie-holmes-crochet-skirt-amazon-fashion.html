It certainly happens to Us quite often. It usually leads to some Googling, just in case we can find the exact piece available on the internet — and actually in budget. It’s pretty much an impossible task. But getting their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">look for less</a>? Now, we know a little something about that.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Katie Holmes</strong></a> is always a top search term on our computers and phones. She does no wrong when it comes to fashion, whether she’s been spotted out on the sidewalks of NYC or at events with boyfriend <strong>Bobby Wooten III</strong>. Speaking of events with her new beau, Holmes recently posed for red carpet photos with him wearing the coolest crochet skirt. We needed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one of our own</a> ASAP!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/katie-holmes-bobby-wooten-iii.jpg><p><strong>Get <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Drop Makayla Crochet Maxi Skirt</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$55</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, June 20, 2022, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>Holmes attended the Tribeca Film Festival on June 14, 2022, wearing a summery designer look that gave Us major heart eyes. Her Chloé skirt was a mix of crochet and macramé, and she added on a matching top for a beachy yet sophisticated ensemble. Sadly, when we looked up the skirt, we saw it was still in the pre-order stage — and $5,705, Eep! But we let out a sigh of relief when we found <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">something ultra-similar</a> on Amazon!</p><p>This crochet skirt is also a maxi style like Holmes and also comes in a soft, natural white shade. The best part, however, is that it costs literally 99% less than the one Holmes wore. It’s on Amazon Prime too, which means members get fast, free shipping! Plus, it also comes with a matching top so you can get the full outfit à la the Dawson’s Creek actress!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/katie-holmes-crochet-skirt.jpg><p><strong>Get <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Drop Makayla Crochet Maxi Skirt</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$55</a> at Amazon!

It has a drawstring waistband, and it fits close to the body but not in a tight or clingy way. It’s even machine washable, which is great to see from a crochet piece. It tells Us that it’s strong and will last and last!</p><p>This skirt has a great size range too, offering sizes XXS to 5X. So, what do you say?
