Sean Combs deleted all of the pictures and videos from his Instagram during the week of June 16, with no press release or statement given before his decision.

It’s currently unclear what inspired Combs’ move to wipe his Instagram. However, his posts uploaded to X/Twitter, including his December 2023 post declaring that “Enough is enough,” remain untouched. Diddy’s IG getting wiped clean arrives only a couple of days after the Bad Boy founder was accused of beating Cassie Ventura over an alleged relationship with <a href=# id=auto-tag_kid-cudi data-tag=kid-cudi>Kid Cudi</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">During an interview with VladTV, Combs’ former bodyguard, Roger Bonds, spoke about an incident in which Puffy went through Ventura’s phone and discovered her contacting Cudder.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bonds alleged that Diddy became enraged at the thought of the two being intimate with each other and headed over to Cudi’s home to confront him. The Man on the Moon artist wasn’t at home then, leading Diddy to take his anger out on someone else. He then approached one of his former employees named Capricorn, a woman whom Combs believed knew about Ventura’s relationship with Kid Cudi, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly physically assaulting her</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“At that particular time, after that happened, Cassie wouldn’t come around and then, all of a sudden, Cassie came around and Diddy was upset,” Bonds explained. “He put hands on Capricorn because of that situation. Capricorn ended up leaving and suing him for it. He paid Capricorn $450,000 to keep her mouth shut.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In May, CNN released footage showing Diddy physically assaulting Cassie at a hotel in 2016. Months before the video dropped, Combs <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>“completely denied and rejected”</a> any of the claims brought forth upon him—including those from his ex. But the footage told another darker, much different tale, showing the mogul losing his temper with Cassie, slamming her to the ground, and flinging household items at her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screen-Shot-2024-06-21-at-9.22.56-AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Diddy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would later issue an apology t</a>o Cassie after the surveillance footage hit the internet, stating, “I take full responsibility for my actions in that video, I was disgusted then when I did it. I’m disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Meredith Firetog, a legal representative for Ventura, released a statement following his statement, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">calling his apology “disingenuous</a>,” saying “Combs’ most recent statement is more about himself than the many people he has hurt…When&nbsp;Cassie&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple other women came forward,&nbsp;</a>he denied everything and suggested that his victims were&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">looking for a payday.&nbsp;</a>That he&nbsp;was only compelled&nbsp;to ‘apologize’ once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch the videos above.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m2pbDYZpuepJWpsrR5wpqqrKGVYq6xu8uonrJlmaPAta3Gq5imZZGhuaazwK2gqKajYn5zf5Nxb3BwZWV8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
