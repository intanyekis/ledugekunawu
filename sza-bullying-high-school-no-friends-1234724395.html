The <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234655720>Grammy-winning artist </a>recalled not attending her own senior prom because she “didn’t have any friends” and also because she “had no one to go to prom with.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 33-year-old also spoke on how <a href=# data-type=post data-id=589571>she was bullied</a>, stating: “I wasn’t quiet and I was awkward at the same time.” On the flip side, she did mention that <a href=# id=auto-tag_bullying data-tag=bullying>bullying</a> is what shaped her into who she is today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-182565318.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In the magazine’s issue for this week, the “Low” crooner shared, “I wasn’t this tiny sad victim, but I was more so attacked just because it was giving ‘What is wrong with you?’ energy. I always thought, ‘Oh my God.’ I’ll never have the approval of anyone in life, this must be my defining factor, this must be the bottom line.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Turning her pain into power, the St. Louis-born singer added, “I realized that all the things that made me feel so lame were actually what made me into who I am. It’s like, I didn’t go to prom because I didn’t have any friends and I had no one to go to prom with … [and now] it’s so weird that my life turned into [having] a bodyguard while traveling to parties.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">SZA also declared her high school experience as the turning point for her to chase her dreams by any means. She refused to allow her Maplewood neighborhood to be her final destination on her path to success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1245366204.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“All these things, if I had such a fulfilling existence and experience in high school, I would’ve felt validated to the point where I didn’t need to do anymore,” she said. “[So] I just had to do more, I had to be more because I was like, ‘This sh*tty experience can’t be the end of it because if it is, I am cooked.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, SZA nèe Solána Imani Rowe, has now found new ways to channel <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234721332>her deep sentiments </a>of feeling inadequate or as he describes it — “trash.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Sometimes it’s crying, sometimes it’s eating my favorite food, or going to the beach, or going for a walk or doing Shambhavi [Mahamudra],” she revealed. “Sometimes it’s just praying straight up by myself and just telling God, ‘Wow, I feel so trash right now and I desperately need your help.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Leaving a few gems behind for those coming after her, she advised: “Everyone who experiences bullying, that just sucks, but it’s going to lead you to something, it has to. If you could hold on and just wait until high school is over because 10 years from now, I promise you, none of those people will matter. I’m grateful.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Read SZA’s entire interview with PEOPLE <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6jHonnBrqOlsZmjtG60yKCfZquTnbywuIynpmaeop6yr7DSZmhra2Rsf3V%2FmG5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
