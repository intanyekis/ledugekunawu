She wanted to protect her family, specifically her daughter and assumed she'd be completely cut from the show.</p><p>"I didn't even know if because of that, I was going to get asked to leave," Davis revealed, "But, somehow, everything worked out for the best. It came down to there were some things going on in our lives that we didn't want to share with the public."</p><p>"We decided for this year, we're not going to let the cameras come home with us. Now, the future is not set, you know, who knows what's going to happen then? But just for this year, we wanted to, you know, look out for, for our family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She admitted that the divorce began messily and at each of their worst mental spaces, only because they were both deeply hurting. However, they haven't lost their sense of family.</p><h2 id=we-re-still-family>We're Still Family</h2><p>"<span style=font-weight:400>Because even when you're not married to someone there's still family. I mean, you're co-parenting and you know, and divorce is not easy."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>"It was very painful. It was very hard, death of a dream, but I was very grateful for Bravo allowing me to stay on and be (a) friend of and participate, participate as much as I did."</span></p><p>Davis is&nbsp;looking forward to continuing her role on&nbsp;Real Housewives and seemed less stressed from her initiation than other women in their first seasons. Thank you after thank you was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">offered to Bravo</a> for its respect for her family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"A<span style=font-weight:400>nyone who knows me in person knows I'm the opposite of boring. I'm very feisty. And it was a good decision this season to not let the cameras come into my home to protect my family. And I am so grateful."</span></p><p>We can't wait to see more of that feisty inner spirit come out once her divorce waters settle and she has more time to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commit to the show</a>. She even described her initial&nbsp;Housewives experience as a "safe space."</p><p>That might be the first time producers have heard that, but the refreshing&nbsp;viewpoint makes us want to hear more of Davis' hot takes.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'RHOD': LeeAnne Locken Calls Stephanie Hollman The 'Biggest Liar'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoaeUYremus2inZ6qXZmut7XSZquhmZ6gwG6u0ZqtqGWWpL9ut8Sep6Kml2KwornEq5isZZGsrrp5xaumpmWYmr9usMivpqublWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
