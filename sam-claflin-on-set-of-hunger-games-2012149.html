A shirtless Claflin — who most recently starred opposite <strong>Kristen Stewart</strong> in Snow White and the Huntsman — looked more muscular than ever, revealing his tight abs and bulging biceps in between takes.</p><p>The day prior, Claflin was seen wearing black spandex pants — the same ones his character uses while training to compete the deathly Quarter Quell. Claflin's costars <strong>Josh Hutcherson</strong>, <strong>Jena</strong> <strong>Malone</strong>, <strong>Willow</strong> <strong>Shields</strong> and <strong>Alan</strong> <strong>Ritchson</strong> were also photographed walking around the set.</p><p>Other actors who were considered for the part of Finnick Odar included The Social Network's <strong>Armie</strong> <strong>Hammer</strong>, 25, Battleship's <strong>Taylor</strong> <strong>Kitsch</strong>, 31, and Country Strong's <strong>Garrett</strong> <strong>Hedlund</strong>, 27.</p><p>"They did [approach me]," Hedlund recently admitted to <a href=#>MTV News</a>. "But I was working on [On the Road] at the time. We shot the whole film in 23 days and I was really immersed in it. I couldn't get around [to reading the Hunger Games novels]."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Everybody around me is flipping out about the books, and I didn't really have the time to sit down lately to read any book, not just Hunger Games," Hedlund added. "But I've got a couple [projects] on my plate that I'm looking forward to reading now."</p><p>Directed by Water for Elephants' <strong>Francis Lawrence</strong> and based on the dystopian novel by <strong>Suzanne</strong> <strong>Collins</strong>, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire will be released in theaters November 22, 2013. Original stars <strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong> and <strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong> will reprise their roles as Katniss Everdeen and Gale Hawthorne, respectively.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqapV2YuaKyy6KlZqeeYsCmwIyonWagpaO0pr6MoJimnaNif3F9kWprcmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
