Dolls aren't usually that scary… not unless you’ve seen movies like <a href=#>Child’s Play </a>and The Conjuring. <a href=#>Let’s delve into these films </a>to uncover why the haunting of dolls is so eerie, and why a producer’s choice to transform an innocent toy into a malevolent being has been so successful in cinematic history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chucky>Chucky</h2><p>Child’s Play was released in 1988 and features an innocent child with a not so innocent plaything…a monstrous doll who has a thirst for blood. The red-headed doll appears to be a sweet toy for children, but what lurks beneath the surface is far more sinister. The film utilizes a child’s toy to house the soul of another. His catchphrase, “Hi, I’m Chucky. Wanna play”? sounds innocent enough, but actually insinuates far more evil intentions. The doll has blue hair and sweet overalls which make him appear childlike and innocent. With his youthful complexion and playful red hair, it is hard to imagine that this toy is actually a monster. We learn later on in the film that the doll is possessed by the spirit of a serial killer named Charles Lee Ray.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film serves as a reminder&nbsp;that fear arises from corrupted innocence and possession. Chucky is initially a sweet friend for young and lonely Andy, he&nbsp;convinces&nbsp;him to say bad words, skip school, and misbehave. His goal is to continue Ray’s killing spree and Chucky stops at nothing to finish the task. According to Frank McAndrew, <a href=#>a professor of psychology at Knox College</a>, “The more lifelike a doll, the more it is to be unsettling to people.” When a doll acts like a person, even if it doesn’t look one hundred percent realistic, it can elicit feelings of unease and uncertainty, rather than attraction. Even though Chucky looks much like any other doll and has cartoonish features,&nbsp;his human essence to him makes him scary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5d00282564430.image_.jpg><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> The 15 Best Horror Movies, Ranked From Least To Most Realistic</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is clear from the beginning of the film that <a href=#>Chucky is out for blood. </a>His violent crimes are intentional and, in some cases, even premeditated. He has human intellect and the ability to outsmart those around him. Many of the smaller deeds that the doll carries out such as switching on the TV, or causing a gas leak, are turned so that the blame is placed on Andy rather than the doll. After all, who would blame a lifeless toy for things going awry? One of the scariest moments in the movie occurs when Andy’s mother begins to have suspicions about the doll and goes back to try to find the box that&nbsp;it came in. When she picks it up, the batteries fall out and Chucky’s secret is revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=annabelle>Annabelle</h2><p>The Conjuring is another film that utilizes a lifeless, or seemingly lifeless doll to elicit fear in audiences. Unlike Chucky, who in many ways looks like an innocent plaything, Annabelle, the haunted doll in this film, looks absolutely evil. She sits in a glass case with hand inscriptions of the Lord’s prayer and a wide smile on her porcelain face. She appears to be a doll that is on display due to the history behind her. However, underneath this beautiful yet eerie toy, is a sign that says “Warning, positively do not open.” In horror movies, when there's a warning, it is almost guaranteed to be ignored. The film is based on a true story, and some highlights of what really happened make their way into the film.</p><p>The films in The Conjuring series have captivated and terrified audiences. The demonic Annabelle is terrifying.&nbsp;Many fans agree that&nbsp;Annabelle Comes Home&nbsp;is the most terrifying film of the bunch.&nbsp;The story takes place after Annabelle and the prologue of The Conjuring,&nbsp;but before that film's&nbsp;key events.&nbsp;In the movie, protagonists Ed and Lorraine bring Annabelle home and lock her in a room where they keep other treasured artifacts. They then leave their daughter Judy in the care of their friend and Judy's babysitter, Daniela. Somehow, the artifacts' room is unveiled, and Annabelle is set free. She wreaks havoc in the house and the children have to figure out a way to get her back into her case before their parents return home. The reason Annabelle is released is because Daniela&nbsp;makes her way into the artifacts' room, trying to reconnect with her father, who passed away.&nbsp;Then, all hell breaks loose. Annabelle begins to&nbsp;appear all over the house, and can be seen rocking in a chair, or smiling creepily in bed with the children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7818.jpg><p>Movies like these are hot commodities and captivate audiences because&nbsp;something that we deem familiar&nbsp;becomes a living nightmare.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The 5 Worst Horror Movie Remakes (And 10 Worth Watching)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6edYrCpwcKksGasn2Kur7rAm5ylpJVixKnFjJqpnmWUpLmteceoqaunomK6sMLInqpmq59isLOxxKmwaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
