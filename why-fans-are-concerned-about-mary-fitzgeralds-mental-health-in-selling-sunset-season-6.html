Fans got concerned, especially since she and Oppenheim had an argument about her workload.</p><p>Ahead of the season's premiere, the reality star opened up about her recent miscarriage as well. A Redditor then claimed: "Literally her situation is so sad. I feel like it already started before this season, even before she openly talked about her relationship and a baby stuff. Jason became more and more openly ignorant for those type of problem. Not taking care of employees is hurting business period."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's what's really going on with Fitzgerald.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Heather El Moussa Get Banned By Selling Sunset?</a></span></p><h2 id=mary-fitzgerald-had-a-miscarriage-during-honeymoon-with-romain-bonnet>Mary Fitzgerald Had A Miscarriage During Honeymoon With Romain Bonnet</h2><p>At the end of March 2023, Fitzgerald posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video on Instagram</a> where she opened up about her miscarriage during her honeymoon with her husband, <a href=#>model-turned-project manager Romain Bonnet</a>, back in January. "On top of the miscarriage, I also had a septic miscarriage," she said while holding back her tears. "So, had to go in for surgery for that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fwdsajyaqae293o.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added that "the only reason why I've been silent for a long time — and the reason why I'm speaking out now — is because I do realize how common this is and how many people go through this." She then noted that although it's been "rough," there's "still hope." She vowed to "keep trying" until she has "good news to share."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Emma Hernan Actually Like Her Selling Sunset Co-Stars And Can They Stand Her?</a></span></p><h2 id=mary-fitzgerald-amp-jason-oppenheim-seem-to-be-having-issues-at-work>Mary Fitzgerald & Jason Oppenheim Seem To Be Having Issues At Work</h2><p>In episode 5, Fitzgerald said in an interview that "there's a lot of pressure" on her to "get these penthouses finished" which has "so much work involved in it," because Oppenheim "wants to get these on the market in three weeks." Heading the project is her husband, Bonnet who was then updating her on the several delays on the project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Romain and I are stuck in between a rock and a hard place because these windows were installed before the new city regulations got put in place," she said of one of the issues, noting that they'd still need HOA approval for the tint solution. Bonnet added: "If they don't approve it, then it's going to cost us, like, a quarter million dollars to replace."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-2023-05-23-at-10-38-49-am.png><p>In the next episode, Fitzgerald broke the bad news to Oppenheim who had just got back from vacation. The broker was "frustrated" seeing the penthouses looking "the exact same as they did when I left three weeks ago." Talking about the window situation, Fitzgerald said that it wasn't on her as Oppenheim was also there during the installation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After further complaints, the realtor said: "This has been really stressful. We're doing our best. We're trying to take over and get everything done for you, but I'm sorry, like, if it's not perfect but we're doing out best." She even added that maybe Oppenheim shouldn't be "gallivanting all over Europe when you have a project this important."</p><p>Still, after she'd told him she's "putting all my personal stuff aside trying to just focus on my clients, which I can barely even take care of right now because I'm trying to handle everything for you," Oppenheim refused to handle Stause and Young's feud because it happened when he was gone. Fitzgerald argued that he was responsible for it because he "brought both of the girls on" himself.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jason Oppenheim Had Some Brutally Honest Thoughts About Christine Quinn’s Selling Sunset Exit</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mary-fitzgerald-mediated-chrishell-stause-amp-nicole-young-39-s-intense-feud>Mary Fitzgerald Mediated Chrishell Stause & Nicole Young's Intense Feud</h2><p>With Oppenheim stepping back from the office drama, Fitzgerald was forced to take the girls to Palm Springs, hoping to resolve the issues between Stause and Young. But it only got worse after the former alleged the latter of doing drugs as a response to initially being accused of getting a listing just because Oppenheim had a crush on her at that time.</p><p>Fitzgerald talked to both girls, calling them out on their mistakes. However, towards the end of the trip, she couldn't help but break down in tears inside their limousine while on the way to a club. They were coming from a heated dinner where Young and Stause had gone at it again. The Vice Manager decided to head home while the rest of the group went dancing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-2023-05-23-at-10-39-49-am.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were quick to express concerns over her possibly experiencing "burnout." A Redditor noticed that "Mary does not seem to be as bubbly and full of energy as usual. I am actually surprised that this is not talked about more. She is mentally and physically and probably psychologically tired."</p><p>They continued: "Crying after the girls trip, taking a nap at work, and If I remember during the first episode, mentioning that it can be hard for her and Romain to find time for their relationship All these things can add up quickly and be damaging for the person."</p><p>They also noted that "Jason has completely disrespected her well-being when she vocally expressed her distress and all the workload she had been doing while he was away. Not listening to your employees when they feel down can lead them to getting a burnout!"</p><p>We guess we'll just have to see what happens next in season 7.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4yaqZ5lk6S7pLHRp5ydZZGXvLbAjKaYq7Fdm7a1xsaeqZqklKh6rrHNrZilZZiarq3Ax2agp2Wjmrmttc2gZKytnqiytXnSnpisp55ig3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
