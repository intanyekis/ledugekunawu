The transition to Ty is a bit jarring, but he sounds great per usual. Ye’s vocals sound good, too, but it would’ve been interesting to hear them on the first beat.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Speaking of production, the beat switch and second beat overall do a bit too much. It sounds like contemporary gospel fused with a little bit of rock and Hip-Hop. It’s not bad, but some self-control and reduction would’ve made this a potentially great record. –&nbsp;Armon Sadler</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l"><a href=# id=auto-tag_fivio-foreign data-tag=fivio-foreign>Fivio Foreign</a> – Pain & Love 2</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/attachment-fivio-foreign-pain-love-2.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A few years after New York’s platoon of drill rappers deployed their aggressive sound across the airwaves, Fivio Foreign has solidified himself as the scene’s most successful ambassador. Nearly two years after the release of his debut album B.I.B.L.E., Fivio <a href=#>doubles back </a>with Pain & Love 2, the sequel to his 2019 EP. Opening the project with “Who Knew,” the Brooklynite basks in his evolution from the streets to a man of means, boasting about his millionaire status and the trappings of his privileged lifestyle.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Rap crooner Vory joins the party on “No Love,” on which Fivio remembers his fallen friend TDott Woo while shunning the embrace of forces against him. Running ten tracks in length, Pain & Love 2 includes a murderous row of features, with Meek Mill, Swae Lee, Lil Tjay, 41, Sheff G, Rowdy Rebel, and Popcaan appearing throughout the proceedings. Presenting a mix of party-starters and emotive salvos, Fivio Foreign’s sophomore effort proves he’s far from a flash in the pan and built for the long-run. – Preezy Brown</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l">Latto – “Sunday” Service”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lssa.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_latto data-tag=latto>Latto</a>’s “<a href=#>Sunday Service</a>” had the recipe for a really good song and slightly missed the mark. It’s clear there is a <a href=#>cold war</a> between her and <a href=#>Ice Spice</a>, but neither are saying each other’s names directly. She slightly raps with the fervor of what someone delivering a diss track would sound like but lacks the edge to really go all the way there. There are cool bars and her flow and delivery are enjoyable. She also meshes well with the mid-tempo production. However, the song lacks an element of excitement and the face-scrunch-worthy punchlines that would make it something that could be called great. –&nbsp;AS</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l">Jermaine Dupri Feat.

A remake of Subway and 702’s classic ’90s R&B smash, the track finds reunited couple Nelly and Ashanti trading vocals amid ad-libs by Dupri, with Juicy J swooping in for an electric guest verse to bring the record home.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With his desire to find a “home for the entire <a href=#>So So Def brand</a>” fulfilled, “This Lil’ Game We Play” puts the music world on notice. JD is gearing up for yet another takeover of the airwaves to extend his label’s 30-year run. – PB</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l"><a href=# id=auto-tag_little-simz data-tag=little-simz>Little Simz</a> – Drop 7</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/attachment-little-simz-drop-7-cover.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Little Simz resumes her Drop series with its seventh installment, which finds <a href=#>the British star </a>taking a more freewheeling approach that results in a whimsical musical ride. An example of this comes on “Fever,” which finds Simz concocting a number that’s equally recitable as it is addictive, a commend trend on the project.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Snubbing unsatisfactory encounters and situations, Simz plays her cards close on “I Ain’t Feelin It,” whereas “Power” finds her in a boastful tone, prancing atop a jittery soundscape. Arriving a full calendar year after her acclaimed 2022 album No Thank You, Drop 7 serves as a more accessible collection that thrives on its stylistic points while retaining the substance Simz is loved for. – PB</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l">Chief Keef & Mike Wil Made It – “Dirty Nachos”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ckmwmidna.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_chief-keef data-tag=chief-keef>Chief Keef</a>’s “Dirty Nachos” is pretty middle of the road. It’s not the most interesting <a href=#>Mike Will Made-It</a> beat and Chief Keef sounds a bit bored on the track. Given the BPM and hi-hats, the song would have been better if he had a bit more energy. There aren’t any memorable lines and the hook is hard to distinguish. When reading its lyrics and seeing the chorus’ words read “Ni**a, get off your block and take a trip, ni**a,” it’s even more underwhelming. This all just felt very low effort and it’s not a song that people will run back to knowing what these two talents are capable of and have produced in the past. –&nbsp;AS</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l">Flau’jae – 4 Wave</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/attachment-flau-jae-johnson-4-wave-album.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">When Flau’jae Johnson released her debut album 4 My Fans, the collegiate baller was months removed from a breakout season at Louisiana State University, which culminated in Johnson and the Tigers winning the NCAA championship. Now, in the midst of her sophomore season, the reigning SEC Freshman of the Year drops a dime to her listenership with her new 4 Wave EP, a mix of tracks that showcase <a href=#>the athletic rhymer’s</a> diverse skillset.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Flexing her vocal abilities on “Hold On,” Flau’jae croons and raps atop a piano-laden backdrop while brandishing her ambitions and vulnerabilities. “Incredible” is an upbeat groove that finds Johnson lamenting the lack of consistency in her romantic dealings, while “Feel No Pain” is a brooding selection that examines the complexities of fame and fortune. Rounded out by its titular freestyle, 4 Wave is an applaudable effort that maintains Flau’jae’s reputation for bringing her A-Game, regardless of the arena. – PB</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l">GloRilla – “Yeah Glo!”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/gyg.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_glorilla data-tag=glorilla>GloRilla</a>’s “Yeah Glo!” is the type of energy she should be bringing at a time when it seemed like she had run out of gas. The hook is simple but energetic. Her verses are fun and elevated by the drums, hi-hats, and synths. She sounds confident like she means everything she says. It’s by no means a hit record, but it is the best record she’s had in quite some time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">If she stays consistent and continues dropping high-energy records with solid raps, this could be the runway for another chart-climbing run. All it takes is one banger for people to be back on her side and put her above the people they tried to edge her out for in the past. –&nbsp;AS</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l"><a href=# id=auto-tag_blu data-tag=blu>Blu</a> – Royal Blu</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/attachment-blu-royal-blu-cover.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">One Hip-Hop artist who has been killing it as of late is Blu, as <a href=#>the Cali veteran</a> has been servicing his core base with a seemingly endless stream of material. For this go-round, Blu connects with producer Roy Royal for Royal Blu, a long-player that finds the rapper hitting on all cylinders.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Paying homage to his palm tree-infested stomping grounds on “L.A. Blu” and “The Same OG,” the proud South Central native who “made it out with a pencil” pitches the lyrical equivalent of a no-hitter. Additional highlights “Living God” and “The Legendary” find Blu closing the album in grand fashion, with Royal Blu serving as the latest testament to his superbness as a wordsmith. – PB</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l"><a href=# id=auto-tag_chow-lee data-tag=chow-lee>Chow Lee</a> – Porno Story</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/clpsa.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Chow Lee’s&nbsp;Porno Story&nbsp;is a refreshing two-pack. “Ms.Beautiful V” is an ode to his lady’s loins. No seriously. He croons, “You and your coochie is twins, you got a beautiful vagina.” It’s another reminder of why the sexy drill subgenre is so great. <a href=#>Cash Cobain</a> laces him with a frantic beat, but Chow finds a way to make it romantic and endearing. Then, on the title track, he brings it home. It’s quite literally like listening to someone narrate a porn video without seeing the visuals, but he illustrates the scene very well. Needless to say, Chow Lee is as much of a h*e as Cash Cobain has described him in previous interviews. But he owns it and it works. –&nbsp;AS</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuHnMrqqim12bv6qwwLJkpJmerrJuw8Ssq2asqWKxsLjLmmSin55is6rCyKhkn6eimraouoylmK2sn2J%2Bc3%2BTcWxpaGRufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
