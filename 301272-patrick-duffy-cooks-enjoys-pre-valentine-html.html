He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/patrick-duffy-still-considers-himself-married-after-wifes-death/>divulged</a> that he felt her presence everywhere, proving their strong connection to each other:</p><p class=dh>"I can hear her. I can see her. I know what she would expect of me, and I try and live up to that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/625b1577d3364e82ab44b7ea7d246f19.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Patrick Duffy and Carlyn Rosser during the Monte Carlo Television Festival 2002 - Independence Day Party on July 4, 2002 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>At the time, Duffy admitted that he had not yet come to terms with Rosser's death, although she had been gone for two years. The director <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/patrick-duffy-still-considers-himself-married-after-wifes-death/>said</a> he doubted whether he would move on, adding that for him, he was still very much married:</p><p class=dh>"I feel close to her all the time [but] what I miss most is her touch. I still consider myself a married man."</p><p class=dh>Duffy recounted when the couple first crossed paths and revealed Rosser was older than him. "I was an immature college graduate touring as a narrator with this dance production. She was a beautiful ballerina ten years older. We met on the tour bus, and that was it – for life," he recalled.</p><p class=dh>Rosser and Duffy's chemistry was so intense that they never even saw themselves dating other people. That strong feeling contributed to his struggle to move on without her after she died.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>How Does Duffy Live Up to His Late Wife's Desires?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Despite feeling pessimistic about being with someone other than his late wife, <a class="me a" href=#>Duffy</a> eventually fell in love again.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Duffy found himself all alone amid quarantine but became used to his life as a widower.</p><p class=dh>Little did he know that it would turn into a joyful period in his life. He and Purl were casual friends back in the day but lost touch. The pair reconnected on a group text chain, and Duffy made the first move by driving to her house.</p><p class=dh>The Hollywood star said he wanted to see whether the connection they developed through texts "was real."
