Additionally, the actors agreed on “Thou shall not kill” as the GOAT commandment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">When speaking of the <a href=# data-type=pmc_list_item data-id=1234767886>GOAT dance move</a>, Taylor hit “The Chicken Head,” as Stanfield busted out with “The Dougie.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch above for more.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Book of Clarence, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234839616>written and directed by Jeymes Samuel and produced by Sean “Jay-Z” Carter,</a> takes place in Jerusalem A.D. 33 and follows the main character, Clarence (Stanfield).&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to synopsis, “A down-on-his-luck man struggles to find a better life for his family while fighting to free himself of debt. Captivated by the power and glory of the rising Messiah, he risks everything to carve his own path to a divine life, ultimately discovering that the redemptive power of belief may be his only way out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MCDBOOF_SP027.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Starring alongside Stanfield are: Alfre Woodard, RJ Cyler, Benedict Cumberbatch,&nbsp;James McAvoy, Omar Sy,&nbsp;Anna Diop, David Oyelowo, and the aforementioned Taylor. James Lassiter and Tendo Nagenda also serve as producers with Jay-Z. Garrett Grant is the film’s executive producer.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Speaking about the Sony film with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, Samuel said, “Clarence is a person that doesn’t believe in anything outside of what’s in front of him, what he can see and hear. Clarence has a lot of inside belief — he has a lot of inside confidence. This man is sure he could fly… [The Book Of Clarence&nbsp;] is a journey of self-belief and world discovery. I think a lot of us have the issue of not only outside belief, but inside belief.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Hov spoke of the importance of the inclusion of Black people in<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234785028> the Bible-esque film.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Most of the stories told in&nbsp;the Old West&nbsp;didn’t include people of color,” he started. “We know they existed. We know we’ve been here just as long as anyone else. Samuels keeps finding fresh ways and perspectives to talk about these stories.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MCDBOOF_SP016.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He went on, “My fear is that people don’t allow that arc to take place, and are immediately judging. This story is about a young man who finds his faith through love and through wanting to become somebody in the world, which is the story of everybody. Everyone wants to find love and everyone wants to leave this place having accomplished something, having left their mark that they’ve been here and hopefully affected the world in a positive way.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Take a look at the official trailer for The Book Of Clarence&nbsp;below and watch the film’s stars, Teyana Taylor and LaKeith Stanfield, have GOAT Talk above.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The film is playing in theaters now.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6myuq3NmmStmamhvLN5y5qinqGknXq0wMCnnaKdnJl6qLvArWSjmalix26%2FzqeeZmliaIF5gJNwanFn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
