For the first time in the series, the majority of the storyline took place in Canada, where June finally ended up after escaping Gilead where she was an imprisoned Handmaid. She reunited with her husband Luke and her BFF Moira, who were raising her daughter Nichole. June and Luke’s daughter Hannah is still in Gilead, though they’ve vowed to get her back. At the end of the season, June masterminded the murder of Commander Fred Lawrence, who raped her repeatedly when she was in Gilead. Fred’s death surely won’t sit well with his wife Serena Joy, who is also in Canada and is pregnant.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Meanwhile in Gilead, Aunt Lydia is still in charge of the imprisoned Handmaids which includes Janine, who failed to make it to Canada with June. June’s lover Nick, who is the father of her daughter Nichole, was promoted to a Commander, though he helped her kill Commander Waterford.

Also, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Alexis Bledel</strong></a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>isn’t returning as Emily/Ofglen</a>, a role she’s played since the first season of the show. Alexis, who won a Guest Actress Emmy Award for her performance in the show, confirmed her departure&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety </a>on May 27. “After much thought, I felt I had to step away from The Handmaid’s Tale at this time,” the actress said in a statement. “I am forever grateful to <strong>Bruce Miller</strong> for writing such truthful and resonant scenes for Emily, and to Hulu, MGM, the cast and crew for their support.”</p><h2>What Do We Know About What Will Happen Next Season?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-Handmaids-Tale-Season-5-Hulu-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Hulu released the season 5 <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>teaser trailer</a> on July 14 which gives a glimpse into the aftermath of Commander Waterford’s murder. “I want her to know it was me,” June ominously says. She’s speaking about&nbsp;Serena, who wears a black veil to her husband’s funeral. U.S. government agent Mark Tuello<strong>&nbsp;</strong>warns June how her actions will have major consequences. “The Handmaid killing her commander. Gilead is not going to let that stand,” he says. June admits she feels Gilead “pulling me back” from Canada. At the end of the teaser, June and Serena come face-to-face and June grabs a gun from behind her back.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>official trailer</a> was released on August 24. June has no remorse for killing Commander Waterford and tells her husband Luke that she “loved it.” Serena wants revenge for her husband’s murder and forms a pro-Gilead group in Canada. Nick and Commander Joseph Lawrence try to hide their involvement in Commander Waterford’s death. June and Luke are determined to reunite with their daughter Hannah and appear to return to Gilead to finally get her back.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Elisabeth Moss previously teased what’s to come in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TVLine</a>. “I will say that the season itself is possibly one of the wilder rides that we’ve had,” the Emmy Award winner said. “We’ve definitely had some seasons [where], you know, a lot happens. Some seasons, not as much happens.&nbsp;I almost can’t keep up with what happens in the upcoming episodes, and it’s not lip service. I truly mean I almost can’t keep up with the amount of activity that’s happening.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In an <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVE interview with <strong>HollywoodLife</strong></a>, Samira Wiley explained that season 5 will explore more of Moira and June’s relationship. “It’s the first time since season one that I felt like I really had my partner back. Except for she’s not the same person,” Samira said. “And we really see their weird struggle and relationship last season. And this season, it’s more of trying to figure out between Moira and June who they are to each other now, and what exactly, as me, as Moira, do I believe?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Samira continued, “We saw so much last season that June is so gung-ho ready to kill everybody, and Moira was like, ‘Hold on, we got a baby to take care of, calm down. So really, it’s trying to figure out how to fight Gilead from within Canada. And how do they do those things differently? And also is it possible to fight Gilead from within Canada, or is that impossible? And if that isn’t possible, then what’s the next step?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Handmaids-Tale-Season-5-Trailer-Hulu-embed.jpg><h2>Who Is on the Creative Team for Season 5?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Creator Bruce Miller is continuing to call the shots for&nbsp;The Handmaid’s Tale&nbsp;season 5. He executive produces the show with<strong> Elisabeth Moss</strong>, <strong>Warren Littlefield,</strong> <strong>Reed Morano</strong>,<strong> Daniel Wilson</strong>, <strong>Illene Chaiken</strong>, <strong>Marissa Jo Cerar</strong>, and more. It’s been confirmed that Elisabeth directed the first two episodes of season 5. She directed three episodes in season 4.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Fans have wondered when&nbsp;The Handmaid’s Tale&nbsp;is going to end, which is something that Bruce addressed <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in an interview</a> before season 5 started filming. “I’m never looking to end it,” he said in August 2021. “I work with a group of very undifficult people; we have a lovely group of writers, a spectacular group of actors and visiting directors and our crew.” He also said, “The team made an incredible TV show. So I’m not so quick to say, ‘oh, you know, let’s just, walk away.’ I don’t know how you felt about the pandemic, but I certainly learned the things of my life that are pretty rare and working with these people is one of them. So, honestly, yes, I know what the end is and I’m not going to overstay my welcome but I’m also not going to rush off if I don’t have to because as long as I am writing for Elisabeth Moss, you know, it really doesn’t get much better.”</p><h2>Is ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Returning For Season 6?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>The Handmaid’s Tale&nbsp;was renewed for a sixth — and final — season on September 8, 2022.
