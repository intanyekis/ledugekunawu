The company was founded by Travis initially as a line of CBD gummies, though it has since expanded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, since the launch, Travis’ new skincare has faced criticism from the public. Many people take issue with how pricey the products are.</p><p>“$130 FOR EYE SERUM IM SCREAMMINGG,” one fan person wrote on Instagram, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> reports. Another person said, “95 dollars for a cleanser?! to literally wash down the drain?!”</p><p>Other critics said the skincare line was unimaginative and expected more from the Blink-182 drummer.</p><p>“He could have done something so much more authentic to him!” one comment read. “Custom temporary tats, a hand cream/ salve for dry hands good enough for drummers. There’s so much!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So far, Travis hasn’t commented on the controversy surrounding his new skincare line.</p><p>Though they’re known to share PDA-filled photos on social media, Kourtney interestingly hasn’t shared about her husband’s new business venture. She has, however, been busy promoting her new line of nutritional gummies, Lemme.</p><p>Earlier this month, the eldest Kardashian sister <a href=#>debuted the brand after working on it for 5 years</a>.</p><p>"My process [with a new product] is take it to my natural doctor, and he would muscle test me with it," she said of developing the supplements. "I would hold the product in my hand, and he would see how it reacts to my body."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kourtney continued, "Some things test well but most of the time things didn't test well on me. I found it so interesting when he would say, 'Oh, it's because they're using corn or corn syrup or it's genetically modified.’”</p><p>The gummies are v egan, non-GMO, gelatin-free, and gluten-free, and promise to have a variety of health benefits, including improving attention and de-stressing.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Tommy Lee Is Trying (Again) To Sell His Calabasas Mansion</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Barker Wellness Co</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBs63VoqpmmpGnuKa%2BjKucpZ2RqLK0ec2ermabkpl6tLfIp5qaqpVir7bAjKKrrGWTlsK0tc2gZJynnqm%2FsMLEq6qyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
