I had to fold my hands in my lap, cross my legs, assist with cooking, and clean the dishes. Video games were NEVER allowed to be played by me.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqlo7uqsYydnJ%2Bnopl6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqq6jGtna2pdqLWww9Jmn56qXajCpK%2FErKpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
