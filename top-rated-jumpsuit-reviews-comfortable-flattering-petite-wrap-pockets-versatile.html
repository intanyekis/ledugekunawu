We’re huge jumpsuit fans, but it can be hard to flex our versatility when our entire outfit is just one piece — especially when it’s not even comfortable enough to wear for more than an hour or two, or at all, without wanting to scream. Yeah, we know the feeling all too well."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Yeah, we know the feeling all too well. When we’re hit with a problem like this, our first instinct may be to give up, but we weren’t going to go down without a fight this time. That’s how we found possibly the best jumpsuit ever made!</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Loveappella Short Sleeve Wrap Top Jumpsuit</a> is a masterpiece. It’s incredibly trendy, but slipping it on doesn’t feel like hopping into a trend; it feels like gently floating atop a cloud. That’s why it has over 250 reviews so far, leaving shoppers absolutely obsessed and wanting more, more, more!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Black-Jumpsuit-Off.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Loveappella Short Sleeve Wrap Top Jumpsuit</a> starting at just<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $88</a> at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p>So many shoppers are saying this jumpsuit may be their “best online purchase yet.” Page after page of reviews, they’re commenting on how “insanely comfortable” and “super flattering it is,” agreeing that it feels like they should be wearing it to bed. As one shopper put it, it “looks like [they’re] wearing a pulled-together outfit” but they actually feel like they’re “wearing pajamas!”</p><p>Even skeptic shoppers are now believers, one saying that “99.9% of the time” jumpsuits aren’t flattering, but this is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the one exception</a> they’ve found. That’s why so many are begging for more colors, saying they would “buy it again in a heartbeat” and never take it off, considering it works for “any occasion” they can think of!</p><p>So, what makes this lightweight jumpsuit the “ultimate versatile summer outfit” that reviewers are insisting we need to see to believe? First off, it’s made of super soft jersey fabric that drapes beautifully over our body. It has a surplice V-neckline that forms the beginning of the wrap style of the bodice — a timeless style we’ll never tire of!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blue-Jumpsuit.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Loveappella Short Sleeve Wrap Top Jumpsuit</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$88</a> at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p>There’s elastic at the natural waist to cinch our shape, also allowing the top to blouse over a bit so it doesn’t cling too tightly. The pants are extra special. They don’t just hang there; they have pleats on the front and actually taper at the bottom, forming a banded cuff around our ankle! Psst, these pants also have scoop pockets!</p><p>This USA-made jumpsuit also has short dolman sleeves and features no zippers, hooks or buttons. So easy. Shoppers also say it “launders well” and “does not wrinkle,” so easy just got even easier!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Loveappella jumpsuit</a> is currently available in three colors, featuring both regular and petite sizing so we can grab our perfect fit. We have the classic Black, the deep Midnight Navy and Olive, an earthy green. All three can be dressed up or down in seconds. It’s all about footwear and accessories!</p><p>Loveappella has created some of our favorite everyday pieces ever, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this maxidress</a>, and we’re thrilled to add this wrap top jumpsuit to our wardrobe staples, not only for the summer but for the entire year! Versatility includes not only occasion, but season, too, and this jumpsuit does it all with finesse. What color are we grabbing first?
