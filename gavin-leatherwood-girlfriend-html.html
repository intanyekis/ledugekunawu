Brittney Rippeon</h2><p>Leatherwood and Rippeon were likely dating sometime in late 2019.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The girlfriend first uploaded a couple of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stories featuring Leatherwood</a> in September 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The first story featured a pile of shredded paper before the camera panned over to his face.&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't know why I did that," he said in a drowsy voice. In her caption, the actress wrote that he was a sleepy boy.</p><p>Around the same time, she uploaded another short clip of her and Leatherwood hanging out with some friends.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, the rumors of them dating solidified a month later. Rippeon&nbsp;uploaded a story featuring a shirtless&nbsp;Leatherwood under the covers.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"Lazy daze and video games," her caption read alongside a "Favourite" sticker pointing towards the Grown-ish actor.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>2. Kiernan Shipka</h2><p>The rumors about&nbsp;Leatherwood dating his&nbsp;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina costar,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Kiernan Shipka</a>, began right after his first on-screen kiss with her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Still, that wasn't the only instance that solidified the idea in the fans' minds. In December 2019,&nbsp;Leatherwood put up a selfie on his Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>The mirror selfie featured Shipka holding the phone while Leatherwood embraced his rumored girlfriend from behind.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Fans might have even shrugged the photo off if it weren't for the caption that read:&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>I love Kiernan. She’s amazing. This is Gavin typing and not Kiernan stealing his phone.</p><p>Very convincing.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from the Instagram post, neither has come out to the press to confirm their relationship.&nbsp;</p><h2>Gavin Leatherwood Is Supposedly Single</h2><p>Rumors aside, it appears as though Leatherwood is not dating anyone at the moment.</p><p>In a recent video on his sister's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube channel</a>, he hinted that he was currently single.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The siblings were taking turns asking and&nbsp;answering questions when this question came up: What's the most pressing thing on your bucket list?&nbsp;</p><p>Leatherwood was the first to answer. He wanted a hug.</p><p>But, when his sister answered that the first item on her bucket list was getting asked out on a date, he said, "I'm right there with you."</p><p>While his on-screen romances never seem to stop amazing fans, they have to make do with these occasional tidbits on social media and elsewhere to satiate their undying curiosity about the actor's real-life girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>That being said, fans have also long specualted that he has a real-world romance with another cast-mate—Luke Cook. But that's a discussion for another time.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ%2BRq7avecuemK2glafEsLvDZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
