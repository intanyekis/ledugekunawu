She could either&nbsp;set aside her iconic bow and high tops or leave the team that she held so dear. But when she failed&nbsp;to make the cut for the A-Team, she had to reevaluate the meaning of dance in her life. Siwa then asked,&nbsp;</p><p>We've all been told we don't fit in before. What if we celebrated everyone being unique?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>When she could not conform to the rules that confined who she was, she joined a new team—The J Team.&nbsp;</p><h2>'The J Team' Was Centered on&nbsp;Her Life</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>During a February 2020 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appearance on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon</a>, the multi-talented teenager explained this musical was centered on her life and staying true to who you are. She added,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even when the world is telling you, ‘It’s not gonna happen, it’s not gonna happen,’ you believing because you’re you. That’s what this movie’s all about.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She also stated that she had originally&nbsp;created 27 songs for the movie but eventually had to narrow it down to six original tracks. Apart from that, the movie would feature two of her older songs.&nbsp;</p><p>For her upcoming release, Siwa will be sharing the screen with&nbsp;Tisha Campbell-Martin,&nbsp;Laura Soltis,&nbsp;Julia Marley,&nbsp;Kerrynton Jones,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kiara T. Romero.</p><h2>Siwa's Coming Out on Twitter</h2><p>While on the subject of being unapologetically oneself, the teenage heartthrob made headlines back in January&nbsp;2021, for coming out as part of the LGBTQ community. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>It all began with Siwa sharing a series of posts on TikTok and Instagram. Following a day with the TikTok collective Pride House LA, the youngster was seen lip-synching to Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' prompting fans to question if she was coming out.&nbsp;</p><p>She later put up a tweet where she told her fans that her cousin got her a new t-shirt. Alongside the tweet was a photograph of Siwa proudly donning a black t-shirt with bold blue letters reading, "BEST. GAY. COUSIN. EVER."</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Addressed Fans via Instagram Live</h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to People</a>, she made the&nbsp;announcement via Instagram live where she explained herself in more detail. She declared her love for her girlfriend <a href=# rel=follow>Kylie Prew</a> and confessed that the announcement was the only thing she hadn't shared with the world.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>All that being said, she acknowledged she did not know what she could "label" herself on&nbsp;the LGBTQ spectrum, while still sounding excited about the possibility of finding out. She added,&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know, bisexual, pansexual, queer, lesbian, gay, straight. I always just say gay because it just kind of covers it or queer because I think the keyword is cool.</p><p>However, later in the video, she said that she could technically be called "pansexual" because that was how she had been her whole life. She also spelled out that she never wanted her coming out to be a big deal.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, both Siwa and her mother had known about it since she was a little kid. However, both of them felt like it was a risk to go out into the world with full disclosure.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>However, since her coming out Siwa has&nbsp;self-proclaimed the title of "the happiest human alive."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKfn7xuv8iwmGasmJp6q3nTnpimZaSnrqq4xKtkqq2Vmr9vtNOmow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
