But right off the bat, fans couldn’t help but notice a weird similarity between her new beau and the father of her eldest child – they have the same name, Gary.</p><p>On the Thursday, June 6 episode of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, Amber, 34, joined a group Zoom call with her co-stars. But it didn’t take long <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">for the reality star to reveal she had a surprise guest</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-footage-mtv.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Teen Mom Cast Might Be Earning More On OnlyFans And Social Media Versus TV">The Teen Mom Cast Might Be Earning More On OnlyFans And Social Media Versus TV</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Various Teen Mom cast members have left the franchise, seemingly leaving a ton of cash on the table in favor of other pursuits.</p><h2 id=amber-rsquo-s-boyfriend-has-the-same-name-as-her-ex>Amber’s Boyfriend Has The Same Name As Her Ex</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-07-at-12-45-26-pm.png><p>Introducing her new partner, Amber announced, “This is my boyfriend,” as Gary made his official debut on the MTV show. “We are now officially a couple,” she confirmed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gary added humorously, “Hello everybody. My name is actually Gary believe it or not.”</p><p>This remark elicited laughter from the cast members, considering that Amber's ex-boyfriend\ is also named Gary. Cameras have long documented Amber and Gary Shirley's turbulent journey as co-parents since their daughter Leah’s birth in November 2008, first starting out on 16 and Pregnant before becoming a part of the original Teen Mom cast.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-brutal-truth-about-aubree-skye-lind-deboer-s-relationship-with-her-teen-mom-2-star-father-adam-lind.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Brutal Truth About Aubree Skye Lind-DeBoer’s Relationship With Her Teen Mom 2 Star Father Adam Lind">The Brutal Truth About Aubree Skye Lind-DeBoer’s Relationship With Her Teen Mom 2 Star Father Adam Lind</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Teen Mom 2 stars Chelsea DeBoer and Adam Lind may no longer be together, but does their daughter Aubree Skyee Lind-DeBoer ever see her father?</p><p>In January, Amber revealed she was in a new relationship, though she declined to provide details as she wanted to keep the romance private. But now that things seemed to have progressed between Amber and Gary, he’s officially made his Teen Mom debut, a huge milestone in the reality T.V. world.</p><h2 id=amber-has-a-tumultuous-dating-history>Amber Has A Tumultuous Dating History</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-07-at-12-44-50-pm.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amber’s relationship with Leah’s father quickly broke down after joining the MTV franchise. One notable incident occurred in 2010, when Amber was arrested for domestic violence against Gary, which resulted in her being charged and eventually serving time in jail.</p><p>Since then, Gary has maintained primary custody of their daughter, while Amber has worked towards getting back in her daughter’s life. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">But her colorful dating history</a> hasn’t helped make the process smoother.</p><p>In 2014, after her release, Amber began dating Matt Baier, a relationship that lasted until 2017. Matt, a much older man, was a controversial figure. He faced numerous allegations from multiple women claiming he had fathered several children and failed to pay child support. Their engagement ended amidst rumors of infidelity and financial issues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following her breakup with Matt, Amber started dating Andrew Glennon, whom she met on the set of Marriage Boot Camp.</p><p>In 2018, Amber and Andrew welcomed their son, James. However, their relationship took a dark turn in July 2019 when Amber was arrested for domestic battery after allegedly assaulting Andrew with a machete while he was holding their son.</p><p>This incident led to a contentious custody battle, with Andrew ultimately being awarded primary custody of James. He has since relocated to California, and Amber has to travel often to see their son. She’s also not allowed to showcase him online, even though Andrew and James were both featured on Teen Mom before their relationship broke down.</p><p>Hopefully Amber’s new romance stands the test of time, and doesn’t result in a dramatic break-up like some of her last relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYppqVp3qxu9GtrqinlKh6r7HWZpmosZantqa6w2arnp2eYrqwuYydnJutpGKzorrSZqWorJmYsm6%2FyKagpZminsG6edOoZJ6wXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
