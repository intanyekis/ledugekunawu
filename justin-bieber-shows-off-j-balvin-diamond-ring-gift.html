In an Instagram Story on Tuesday, November 19, the 25-year-old showed off a massive diamond ring on his left pointer finger. Through colorful emojis, he thanked J Balvin for the bauble.
The giant square-cut stone sits on a thick silver band and it is a truly blinding work of art. It makes his simple gold wedding band that sits two fingers down from it seem puny."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It makes his simple gold wedding band that sits two fingers down from it seem puny. And it most certainly is not! In fact, his wedding ring is an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18-karat gold Tiffany & Co. ring </a>that retails for roughly $950.</p><p>This small little glimpse at the Latino singer’s <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> led some to assume that the duo might be working together on new music. After all, the Biebs has been teasing that he’s dropping new music sooner rather than later.</p><p>On October Sunday, October 27, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote</a>, “If this gets 20 million likes Justin Bieber will release an album before Christmas,” in an Instagram. Then in the caption, he added, “Share it, like it, post in your story, I gotta see the demand. Love you guys pumped for it! I’m almost done but your support will make me move faster.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Not to mention, this wouldn’t be the first time the two songwriters worked together. Their first collab was back in 2015 on a Latino remix of his hit single “Sorry.”</p><p>The “Love Yourself” singer isn’t afraid to show off his bling. For his wedding on Monday, September 30, he dressed up his classic black and white tuxedo with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a sparkly studded grill</a> that sat on his bottom teeth. But that wasn’t it! He also rocked a $60,000 gold Audemars Piguet watch that he splurged on from Jadelle Beverly Hills.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2FCtMDIp2SboZWXsrN50qGmsKtdpLOneclmmZqkpp67brDImqSoppRiv6q6xmaeop6kZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
