While he's dabbled in television to a pretty immense degree, is busy fathering his kids, and is making waves in business and activism, we still all know and love him on the Hollywood big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>That 70's Show: Every Cast Member Then And Now</a></span></p><p>This man has been in quite a few projects, and it goes without saying that not all of them could break the bank. While some of these may be hidden gems, you might just want to avoid some of the others. Here are Ashton Kutcher's 10 lowest-grossing movies based on Domestic gross and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Box Office Mojo</a>.</p><h2 id=killers-2010---47-1-million>Killers (2010) - $47.1 million</h2><p>This romantic comedy has an action-packed twist. Starring Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher (two of our favorite romantics), these two play a newly married couple. However, their lives become complicated when they find out their neighbors might be contract killers assigned to kill them. Yes, this movie is absurd, and it didn't even do all that well with the critics. Still, for this type of flick, $47 million isn't exactly something to sneer at. Still, it takes a slot on this list, even if it's the first one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dude-where-s-my-car-2000---46-7-million>Dude, Where's My Car? (2000) - $46.7 million</h2><p>This is probably one of Ashton's most iconic roles to date. Again, this movie isn't fantastic, and it's actually a pretty terrible comedy. However, it managed to rake in $46 million, which, is one of the lowest of this successful actor, but isn't half bad. Starring alongside Seann William Scott and Jennifer Garner, two potheads wake up after a night of partying, and, they can't find their car. This is a classic comedy, and we know you all love it despite how terrible it is.</p><h2 id=a-lot-like-love-2005---21-8-million>A Lot Like Love (2005) - $21.8 million</h2><p>This is another romantic comedy, but this time Ashton stars with Amanda Peet. These two are unacquainted, but end up joining the mile high club on a flight to NYC. However, their story isn't over, and they continue bumping into each other for the next 7 years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mila Kunis' Family Shirt: 15 Photos That Prove The Kutchers Are #RelationshipGoals</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is clearly a "they're meant to be flick", and it isn't actually all that bad for a cheesy rom-com. Of course, $21 million isn't bad, either, but it's definitely not one of Ashton's more popular romantic comedies.</p><h2 id=down-to-you-2000---20-million>Down to You (2000) - $20 million</h2><p>Clearly, Ashton participates in a lot of romcoms, and also, they don't gross too well at the box office. This one stars Freddie Prince Jr., Julia Stiles, and Selma Blair, and our man Ashton acts as a secondary character. This is a typical summer fling romance flick, and we're sure it wasn't turning too many heads at the theater. Still, for a comedy that only managed a flat 5/10 on IMDb, we're actually thinking that $20 million ain't bad.</p><h2 id=jobs-2013---16-1-million>Jobs (2013) - $16.1 million</h2><p>This has also become an iconic role of Ashton's, and everyone has at least seen a picture of him from this flick floating around the internet. Obviously, Ashton Kutcher plays Steve Jobs in this biography drama.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Biopics About Celebrities That Are Worth Watching</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While his rise from college dropout to successful entrepreneur is an interesting story, this movie was kind of a flop. It clearly didn't pull in a lot of revenue, and it also didn't score high with the critics. This could have been a break out for Ashton, but unfortunately, this movie kind of fell off the radar.</p><h2 id=my-boss-s-daughter-2003---15-5-million>My Boss's Daughter (2003) - $15.5 million</h2><p>Look out, here comes another romantic comedy! This time, Ashton gets Tara Reid. You can probably guess from the title, but a man finds himself infatuated with his boss's daughter, but he can't seem to find a good enough plan to spend time with her. This movie is cringy and funny, but it is DEFINITELY one of Ashton's worst rom-com, based on box office and critic scores. So, watch this cheesy comedy at your own risk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bobby-2006---11-2-million>Bobby (2006) - $11.2 million</h2><p>This is probably one of the only truly hidden gems on the list. This biography drama tells the story of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination in 1968. Starring Anthony Hopkins, Demi Moore, Sharon Stone, Laurence Fishburne, and many more, our lovely Ashton takes a secondary (and wild) role as Fisher. This is an incredible story, and this flick actually managed a 7/10 on IMDb. Clearly, it didn't have a big release, and this film probably totally slipped your radar. So, we're here to tell you that box office isn't everything, and this is definitely an interesting flick worth your time.</p><h2 id=texas-rangers-2001---623-300>Texas Rangers (2001) - $623,300</h2><p>This is one of Ashton's first flicks, and we'll be honest, it wasn't that great. Still, this one is actually an action-adventure, which is different for this talented actor. Starring James Van Der Beek and Rachael Leigh Cook alongside Kutcher, this movie tells the stories of a young group who band together after the American Civil War.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Highest-Grossing Ryan Gosling Movies of All Time</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They name themselves (you guessed it) the Texas Rangers, and they try to clean up the West. This movie didn't do so hot with the critics, and clearly, it didn't so well at the box office, either. Still, it's kind of entertaining, even if no one headed to the theater to see it.</p><h2 id=spread-2009---250-600>Spread (2009) - $250,600</h2><p>This movie barely broke 1/4 of a million dollars, and definitely got a pretty small release. This isn't exactly a hidden gem, but this is another romantic comedy. However, this one is a bit more "adult", and follows a serial womanizer and, of course, his lover. Starring Ashton Kutcher, you can expect to see some pretty hilarious and cringy scenes from this man. It didn't do well with the critics or at the box office, but that's probably because this R-Rated flick didn't get released too far. Still, it's kind of fun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=coming-soon-1999---5-400>Coming Soon (1999) - $5,400</h2><p>This was actually Ashton Kutcher's first acting credit. While he has a secondary role, we couldn't help but include it. This romantic comedy is definitely an R-Rated film, and follows young and wealthy women from Manhattan as they celebrate their sexual "coming of age". You bet this is set at a prep school, and not every encounter ends so great. Obviously, this movie was probably released in like, one theater, and only grossed about $5,000. It also did super bad with the critics. However, we know you're dying to see Ashton's first ever flick. Also, we're ignoring the title of this movie.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Lowest-Grossing James Franco Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8Csn62nnmK4tsDCoZyrZZykxKa%2F02aeq6ejqLavs4ympq%2Bhlah8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
