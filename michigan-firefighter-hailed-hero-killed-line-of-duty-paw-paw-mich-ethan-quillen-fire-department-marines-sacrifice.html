"That thought never crossed my mind. But now I’m not going to let him down or his family down.”</p><p>Quillen left the dinner table Feb. 22 to respond to a downed power line, expecting to return home shortly to his wife and young child.</p>He gave the ultimate sacrifice, he left his dinner table, a 20-minute call, right?" DeGroff said. "Get it done, go back home, back to your family, and eat your dinner. We do it hundreds of times a year. He didn’t make it back home.”<p>The original power line was handled, but further down a tree broke, causing a power line to collapse and electrocute Quillen, according to Michigan State Police.<br></p><p>Now, flowers, memorabilia and a hand-drawn picture of the fallen hero line the inside of the Paw Paw Fire Department.</p><p>The memorial has continued to grow since his death, with a stuffed firefighter, his Marines hat and notes from the small community and beyond.</p><p>“He always had the smile,” the chief said. “He was always happy with life and got along with everyone.
